0x80008006 | A lookup request was made that required connectivity to the domain controller %1.\r\nThe local LSA was unable to contact the LSA on the remote domain controller.  \r\nPlease check connectivity and secure channel setup from this domain controller \r\nto the domain controller %2.\r\n
0x80008007 | A lookup request was made that required the lookup services on the remote domain controller\r\n%1.  The remote domain controller failed the request thus the local LSA failed the\r\noriginal lookup request.  Please check connectivity and secure channel setup from\r\nthis domain controller to the domain controller %2.\r\n
0x80008008 | A lookup request was made that required a Global Catalog. The LSA was unable\r\nto either contact or authenticate to a Global Catalog and thus failed the lookup\r\nrequest.  Please check the connectivity and authentication of this domain controller\r\nto a Global Catalog.\r\n

0x8000800a | The name %1 was translated to SID %2 from the trusted forest %3.  The domain portion\r\nof the SID is not in the list of acceptable SID's found on the trusted domain object, thus\r\nthis name to SID translation has been ignored.\r\n
0x80009008 | No suitable default server credential exists on this system. This will prevent\r\nserver applications that expect to make use of the system default credentials\r\nfrom accepting SSL connections. An example of such an application is the directory\r\nserver. Applications that manage their own credentials, such as the internet\r\ninformation server, are not affected by this.\r\n
0x8000900b | The remote server has requested SSL client authentication, but no suitable client\r\ncertificate could be found. An anonymous connection will be attempted. This SSL\r\nconnection request may succeed or fail, depending on the server's policy settings.\r\n
0x8000900d | The certificate received from the remote client application has not validated\r\ncorrectly. The error code is 0x%1. The attached data contains the client\r\ncertificate.\r\n
0x8000900e | The certificate received from the remote client application is not suitable for\r\ndirect mapping to a client system account, possibly because the authority that\r\nissuing the certificate is not sufficiently trusted. The error code is 0x%1. The\r\nattached data contains the client certificate.\r\n
0x8000900f | The certificate received from the remote client application was not successfully\r\nmapped to a client system account. The error code is 0x%1. This is not necessarily\r\na fatal error, as the server application may still find the certificate acceptable.\r\n
0x80009015 | When asking for client authentication, this server sends a list of trusted\r\ncertificate authorities to the client. The client uses this list to choose\r\na client certificate that is trusted by the server. Currently, this server trusts\r\nso many certificate authorities that the list has grown too long. This list has\r\nthus been truncated. The administrator of this machine should review the \r\ncertificate authorities trusted for client authentication and remove those that \r\ndo not really need to be trusted.\r\n

0x00009009 | No supported cipher suites were found when initiating an SSL connection. This indicates a configuration problem with the client application and/or the installed cryptographic modules. The SSL connection request has failed.\r\n
0x0000900a | An %1 connection request was received from a remote client application, but none of the cipher suites supported by the client application are supported by the server. The SSL connection request has failed.\r\n
0x0000900b | The remote server has requested SSL client authentication, but no suitable client certificate could be found. An anonymous connection will be attempted. This SSL connection request may succeed or fail, depending on the server's policy settings.\r\n

0x00009012 | The certificate received from the remote server was issued by an untrusted certificate authority. Because of this, none of the data contained in the certificate can be validated. The SSL connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009013 | The certificate received from the remote server has been revoked. This means that the certificate authority that issued the certificate has invalidated it. The SSL connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009014 | The certificate received from the remote server does not contain the expected name. It is therefore not possible to determine whether we are connecting to the correct server. The server name we were expecting is %1. The SSL connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009015 | When asking for client authentication, this server sends a list of trusted certificate authorities to the client. The client uses this list to choose a client certificate that is trusted by the server. Currently, this server trusts so many certificate authorities that the list has grown too long. This list has thus been truncated. The administrator of this machine should review the certificate authorities trusted for client authentication and remove those that do not really need to be trusted.\r\n
0x00009016 | No suitable default server credential exists on this system. This will prevent server applications that expect to make use of the system default credentials from accepting SSL connections. An example of such an application is the directory server. Applications that manage their own credentials, such as the internet information server, are not affected by this.\r\n

0x00008006 | A lookup request was made that required connectivity to the domain controller %1. The local LSA was unable to contact the LSA on the remote domain controller. Please check connectivity and secure channel setup from this domain controller to the domain controller %2.\r\n
0x00008007 | A lookup request was made that required the lookup services on the remote domain controller %1. The remote domain controller failed the request thus the local LSA failed the original lookup request. Please check connectivity and secure channel setup from this domain controller to the domain controller %2.\r\n
0x00008009 | The LSA was unable to register its RPC interface over the TCP/IP interface. Please make sure that the protocol is properly installed.\r\n

0x00009001 | A fatal error occurred while opening the system %1 cryptographic module. Operations that require the SSL or TLS cryptographic protocols will not work correctly. The error code is %2.\r\n
0x00009003 | Creating a TLS %1 credential.\r\n
0x00009004 | The TLS %1 credential's private key has the following properties:%n%n   CSP name: %2%n   CSP type: %3%n   Key name: %4%n   Key Type: %5%n   Key Flags: %6%n%n The attached data contains the certificate.\r\n
0x00009005 | The TLS %1 credential's certificate does not have a private key information property attached to it. This most often occurs when a certificate is backed up incorrectly and then later restored. This message can also indicate a certificate enrollment failure.\r\n
0x00009006 | A fatal error occurred when attempting to access the TLS %1 credential private key. The error code returned from the cryptographic module is %2. The internal error state is %3.\r\n
0x00009007 | A fatal error occurred while creating a TLS %1 credential. The internal error state is %2.\r\n
0x00009008 | The TLS %1 specified certificate's chain could not be retrieved:%n%n   Failure Status: %2%n   Flags: %3%n%n The attached data contains the certificate.\r\n
0x00009009 | No supported cipher suites were found when initiating a TLS connection. This indicates a configuration problem with the client application and/or the installed cryptographic modules. The TLS connection request has failed.\r\n
0x0000900a | An %1 connection request was received from a remote client application, but none of the cipher suites supported by the client application are supported by the server. The TLS connection request has failed.\r\n
0x0000900b | The remote server has requested TLS client authentication, but no suitable client certificate could be found. An anonymous connection will be attempted. This TLS connection request may succeed or fail, depending on the server's policy settings.\r\n
0x0000900c | The certificate received from the remote server has not validated correctly. The error code is %1. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x0000900d | The certificate received from the remote client application has not validated correctly. The error code is %1. The attached data contains the client certificate.\r\n
0x0000900e | The certificate received from the remote client application is not suitable for direct mapping to a client system account, possibly because the authority that issuing the certificate is not sufficiently trusted. The error code is %1. The attached data contains the client certificate.\r\n
0x0000900f | The certificate received from the remote client application was not successfully mapped to a client system account. The error code is %1. This is not necessarily a fatal error, as the server application may still find the certificate acceptable.\r\n
0x00009010 | A TLS %1 handshake completed successfully. The negotiated cryptographic parameters are as follows.%n%n   Protocol version: %2%n   CipherSuite: %3%n   Exchange strength: %4 bits%n   Context handle: %5%n   Target name: %6%n   Local certificate subject name: %7%n   Remote certificate subject name: %8\r\n
0x00009011 | The certificate received from the remote server has either expired or is not yet valid. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009012 | The certificate received from the remote server was issued by an untrusted certificate authority. Because of this, none of the data contained in the certificate can be validated. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009013 | The certificate received from the remote server has been revoked. This means that the certificate authority that issued the certificate has invalidated it. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009014 | The certificate received from the remote server does not contain the expected name. It is therefore not possible to determine whether we are connecting to the correct server. The server name we were expecting is %1. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009015 | When asking for client authentication, this server sends a list of trusted certificate authorities to the client. The client uses this list to choose a client certificate that is trusted by the server. Currently, this server trusts so many certificate authorities that the list has grown too long. This list has thus been truncated. The administrator of this machine should review the certificate authorities trusted for client authentication and remove those that do not really need to be trusted.\r\n
0x00009016 | No suitable default server credential exists on this system. This will prevent server applications that expect to make use of the system default credentials from accepting SSL connections. An example of such an application is the directory server. Applications that manage their own credentials, such as the internet information server, are not affected by this.\r\n
0x00009017 | A fatal alert was received from the remote endpoint. The TLS protocol defined fatal alert code is %1.\r\n
0x00009018 | A fatal alert was generated and sent to the remote endpoint. This may result in termination of the connection. The TLS protocol defined fatal error code is %1. The Windows SChannel error state is %2.%n%n   Target name: %3\r\n
0x00009019 | The TLS %1 specified certificate's chain is incomplete:%n%n   Failure Status: %2%n%n This can cause trust validation failures or interoperability problems. For more information see KB 954755%n The attached data contains the certificate.\r\n
0x0000a000 | The Security System detected an authentication error for the server %1. The failure code from authentication protocol %2 was %3.\r\n
0x0000a001 | The Security System could not establish a secured connection with the server %1. No authentication protocol was available.\r\n
0x0000a002 | The Security System was unable to authenticate to the server %1 because the server has completed the authentication, but the client authentication protocol %2 has not.\r\n
0x0000a004 | The Security System received an authentication attempt with an unknown authentication protocol. The request has failed.\r\n
0x0000a005 | The Security System has selected %2 for the authentication protocol to server %1.\r\n
0x0000a006 | The Security System has received an authentication attempt, and determined that the protocol %1 preferred by the client is acceptable.\r\n
0x0000a007 | The Security System has received an authentication request directly for authentication protocol %1.\r\n
0x0000a008 | The Security System has received an authentication request that could not be decoded. The request has failed.\r\n
0x0000a009 | The Security System has received an authentication attempt, and determined that the protocol %1 is the common protocol.\r\n
0x0000b000 | Logon cache was disabled. Intermittent authentication failures may result during periods of network latency or interrupts. Please contact your system administrator.\r\n
0x0000b001 | A failed logon attempt has caused a logon cache entry for user %1 to be deleted. The authentication package was %2, and the error message was %3.\r\n
0x0000b002 | A logon cache entry for user %1 was the oldest entry and was removed. The timestamp of this entry was %2.\r\n
0x01009020 | Verification of the DTLS connection request failed.\r\n
0x01009021 | DTLS record was rejected because it is outside of current receive window.\r\n

0x00009009 | No supported cipher suites were found when initiating a TLS connection. This indicates a configuration problem with the client application and/or the installed cryptographic modules. The TLS connection request has failed.\r\n
0x0000900a | An %1 connection request was received from a remote client application, but none of the cipher suites supported by the client application are supported by the server. The TLS connection request has failed.\r\n
0x0000900b | The remote server has requested TLS client authentication, but no suitable client certificate could be found. An anonymous connection will be attempted. This TLS connection request may succeed or fail, depending on the server's policy settings.\r\n
0x0000900c | The certificate received from the remote server has not validated correctly. The error code is %1. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x0000900d | The certificate received from the remote client application has not validated correctly. The error code is %1. The attached data contains the client certificate.\r\n
0x0000900e | The certificate received from the remote client application is not suitable for direct mapping to a client system account, possibly because the authority that issuing the certificate is not sufficiently trusted. The error code is %1. The attached data contains the client certificate.\r\n
0x0000900f | The certificate received from the remote client application was not successfully mapped to a client system account. The error code is %1. This is not necessarily a fatal error, as the server application may still find the certificate acceptable.\r\n

0x00009012 | The certificate received from the remote server was issued by an untrusted certificate authority. Because of this, none of the data contained in the certificate can be validated. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009013 | The certificate received from the remote server has been revoked. This means that the certificate authority that issued the certificate has invalidated it. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009014 | The certificate received from the remote server does not contain the expected name. It is therefore not possible to determine whether we are connecting to the correct server. The server name we were expecting is %1. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009015 | When asking for client authentication, this server sends a list of trusted certificate authorities to the client. The client uses this list to choose a client certificate that is trusted by the server. Currently, this server trusts so many certificate authorities that the list has grown too long. This list has thus been truncated. The administrator of this machine should review the certificate authorities trusted for client authentication and remove those that do not really need to be trusted.\r\n
0x00009016 | No suitable default server credential exists on this system. This will prevent server applications that expect to make use of the system default credentials from accepting SSL connections. An example of such an application is the directory server. Applications that manage their own credentials, such as the internet information server, are not affected by this.\r\n

0x00008005 | A lookup request was made that required connectivity to a domain controller in domain %1. The LSA was unable to find a domain controller in the domain and thus failed the request. Please check connectivity and secure channel setup from this domain controller to the domain %2.\r\n
0x00008006 | A lookup request was made that required connectivity to the domain controller %1. The local LSA was unable to contact the LSA on the remote domain controller. Please check connectivity and secure channel setup from this domain controller to the domain controller %2.\r\n
0x00008007 | A lookup request was made that required the lookup services on the remote domain controller %1. The remote domain controller failed the request thus the local LSA failed the original lookup request. Please check connectivity and secure channel setup from this domain controller to the domain controller %2.\r\n
0x00008009 | The LSA was unable to register its RPC interface over the TCP/IP interface. Please make sure that the protocol is properly installed.\r\n
0x0000800c | The LSA was unable to notify UBPM during startup with status %1.\r\n
0x00009000 | The schannel security package has loaded successfully.\r\n
0x00009001 | A fatal error occurred while opening the system %1 cryptographic module. Operations that require the SSL or TLS cryptographic protocols will not work correctly. The error code is %2.\r\n
0x00009003 | Creating a TLS %1 credential.\r\n
0x00009004 | The TLS %1 credential's private key has the following properties:%n%n   CSP name: %2%n   CSP type: %3%n   Key name: %4%n   Key Type: %5%n   Key Flags: %6%n%n The attached data contains the certificate.\r\n
0x00009005 | The TLS %1 credential's certificate does not have a private key information property attached to it. This most often occurs when a certificate is backed up incorrectly and then later restored. This message can also indicate a certificate enrollment failure.\r\n
0x00009006 | A fatal error occurred when attempting to access the TLS %1 credential private key. The error code returned from the cryptographic module is %2. The internal error state is %3.\r\n
0x00009007 | A fatal error occurred while creating a TLS %1 credential. The internal error state is %2.\r\n
0x00009008 | The TLS %1 specified certificate's chain could not be retrieved:%n%n   Failure Status: %2%n   Flags: %3%n%n The attached data contains the certificate.\r\n
0x00009009 | No supported cipher suites were found when initiating a TLS connection. This indicates a configuration problem with the client application and/or the installed cryptographic modules. The TLS connection request has failed.\r\n
0x0000900a | An %1 connection request was received from a remote client application, but none of the cipher suites supported by the client application are supported by the server. The TLS connection request has failed.\r\n
0x0000900b | The remote server has requested TLS client authentication, but no suitable client certificate could be found. An anonymous connection will be attempted. This TLS connection request may succeed or fail, depending on the server's policy settings.\r\n
0x0000900c | The certificate received from the remote server has not validated correctly. The error code is %1. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x0000900d | The certificate received from the remote client application has not validated correctly. The error code is %1. The attached data contains the client certificate.\r\n
0x0000900e | The certificate received from the remote client application is not suitable for direct mapping to a client system account, possibly because the authority that issuing the certificate is not sufficiently trusted. The error code is %1. The attached data contains the client certificate.\r\n
0x0000900f | The certificate received from the remote client application was not successfully mapped to a client system account. The error code is %1. This is not necessarily a fatal error, as the server application may still find the certificate acceptable.\r\n
0x00009010 | A TLS %1 handshake completed successfully. The negotiated cryptographic parameters are as follows.%n%n   Protocol version: %2%n   CipherSuite: %3%n   Exchange strength: %4 bits%n   Context handle: %5%n   Target name: %6%n   Local certificate subject name: %7%n   Remote certificate subject name: %8\r\n
0x00009011 | The certificate received from the remote server has either expired or is not yet valid. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009012 | The certificate received from the remote server was issued by an untrusted certificate authority. Because of this, none of the data contained in the certificate can be validated. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009013 | The certificate received from the remote server has been revoked. This means that the certificate authority that issued the certificate has invalidated it. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009014 | The certificate received from the remote server does not contain the expected name. It is therefore not possible to determine whether we are connecting to the correct server. The server name we were expecting is %1. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009015 | When asking for client authentication, this server sends a list of trusted certificate authorities to the client. The client uses this list to choose a client certificate that is trusted by the server. Currently, this server trusts so many certificate authorities that the list has grown too long. This list has thus been truncated. The administrator of this machine should review the certificate authorities trusted for client authentication and remove those that do not really need to be trusted.\r\n
0x00009016 | No suitable default server credential exists on this system. This will prevent server applications that expect to make use of the system default credentials from accepting SSL connections. An example of such an application is the directory server. Applications that manage their own credentials, such as the internet information server, are not affected by this.\r\n
0x00009017 | A fatal alert was received from the remote endpoint. The TLS protocol defined fatal alert code is %1.\r\n
0x00009018 | A fatal alert was generated and sent to the remote endpoint. This may result in termination of the connection. The TLS protocol defined fatal alert code is %1.%n%n   Target name: %3%n%nThe TLS alert registry can be found at http://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-6\r\n
0x00009019 | The TLS %1 specified certificate's chain is incomplete:%n%n   Failure Status: %2%n%n This can cause trust validation failures or interoperability problems. For more information see KB 954755%n The attached data contains the certificate.\r\n
0x0000a000 | The Security System detected an authentication error for the server %1. The failure code from authentication protocol %2 was %3.\r\n
0x0000a001 | The Security System could not establish a secured connection with the server %1. No authentication protocol was available.\r\n
0x0000a002 | The Security System was unable to authenticate to the server %1 because the server has completed the authentication, but the client authentication protocol %2 has not.\r\n
0x0000a004 | The Security System received an authentication attempt with an unknown authentication protocol. The request has failed.\r\n
0x0000a005 | The Security System has selected %2 for the authentication protocol to server %1.\r\n
0x0000a006 | The Security System has received an authentication attempt, and determined that the protocol %1 preferred by the client is acceptable.\r\n
0x0000a007 | The Security System has received an authentication request directly for authentication protocol %1.\r\n
0x0000a008 | The Security System has received an authentication request that could not be decoded. The request has failed.\r\n
0x0000a009 | The Security System has received an authentication attempt, and determined that the protocol %1 is the common protocol.\r\n
0x0000b000 | Logon cache was disabled. Intermittent authentication failures may result during periods of network latency or interrupts. Please contact your system administrator.\r\n
0x0000b001 | A failed logon attempt has caused a logon cache entry for user %1 to be deleted. The authentication package was %2, and the error message was %3.\r\n
0x0000b002 | A logon cache entry for user %1 was the oldest entry and was removed. The timestamp of this entry was %2.\r\n

0x00001794 | The program %2, with the assigned Process ID %1, supplied a NULL or empty target name for the pszTargetName parameter when calling the InitializeSecurityContext API to initiate an outbound NTLM security context. This is a security risk when mutual authentication is required.%n %n To help protect against a malicious attack, make your code more secure. To do this, change the program so that it specifies a target name in the pszTargetName parameter field, and then recompile the code.\r\n
0x00001795 | The program %2, with the assigned process ID %1, could not authenticate locally by using the target name %3. The target name used is not valid. A target name should refer to one of the local computer names, for example, the DNS host name.%n %n Try a different target name.\r\n

0x0000900a | An %1 connection request was received from a remote client application, but none of the cipher suites supported by the client application are supported by the server. The TLS connection request has failed.\r\n
0x0000900b | The remote server has requested TLS client authentication, but no suitable client certificate could be found. An anonymous connection will be attempted. This TLS connection request may succeed or fail, depending on the server's policy settings.\r\n
0x0000900c | The certificate received from the remote server has not validated correctly. The error code is %1. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n

0x00009012 | The certificate received from the remote server was issued by an untrusted certificate authority. Because of this, none of the data contained in the certificate can be validated. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009013 | The certificate received from the remote server has been revoked. This means that the certificate authority that issued the certificate has invalidated it. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009014 | The certificate received from the remote server does not contain the expected name. It is therefore not possible to determine whether we are connecting to the correct server. The server name we were expecting is %1. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009015 | When asking for client authentication, this server sends a list of trusted certificate authorities to the client. The client uses this list to choose a client certificate that is trusted by the server. Currently, this server trusts so many certificate authorities that the list has grown too long. This list has thus been truncated. The administrator of this machine should review the certificate authorities trusted for client authentication and remove those that do not really need to be trusted.\r\n
0x00009016 | No suitable default server credential exists on this system. This will prevent server applications that expect to make use of the system default credentials from accepting SSL connections. An example of such an application is the directory server.

0x00009011 | The certificate received from the remote server has either expired or is not yet valid. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009012 | The certificate received from the remote server was issued by an untrusted certificate authority. Because of this, none of the data contained in the certificate can be validated. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009013 | The certificate received from the remote server has been revoked. This means that the certificate authority that issued the certificate has invalidated it. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009014 | The certificate received from the remote server does not contain the expected name. It is therefore not possible to determine whether we are connecting to the correct server. The server name we were expecting is %1. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.\r\n
0x00009015 | When asking for client authentication, this server sends a list of trusted certificate authorities to the client. The client uses this list to choose a client certificate that is trusted by the server. Currently, this server trusts so many certificate authorities that the list has grown too long. This list has thus been truncated. The administrator of this machine should review the certificate authorities trusted for client authentication and remove those that do not really need to be trusted.\r\n
0x00009016 | No suitable default server credential exists on this system. This will prevent server applications that expect to make use of the system default credentials from accepting SSL connections. An example of such an application is the directory server. Applications that manage their own credentials, such as the internet information server, are not affected by this.\r\n
0x00009017 | A fatal alert was received from the remote endpoint. The TLS protocol defined fatal alert code is %1.\r\n
0x00009018 | A fatal alert was generated and sent to the remote endpoint. This may result in termination of the connection. The TLS protocol defined fatal alert code is %1.%n%n   Target name: %3%n%nThe TLS alert registry can be found at http://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-6\r\n
0x00009019 | The TLS %1 specified certificate's chain is incomplete:%n%n   Failure Status: %2%n%n This can cause trust validation failures or interoperability problems. For more information see KB 954755%n The attached data contains the certificate.\r\n
0x00009040 | Could not retrieve an OCSP response.%n%n   The Failure Reason is: %1%n    The OCSP Url is: %2%n   The previous OCSP response contained the following times:%n      ThisUpdate: %3%n      NextUpdate: %4%n%nThe attached data contains the certificate.\r\n
0x0000a000 | The Security System detected an authentication error for the server %1. The failure code from authentication protocol %2 was %3.\r\n
0x0000a001 | The Security System could not establish a secured connection with the server %1. No authentication protocol was available.\r\n
0x0000a002 | The Security System was unable to authenticate to the server %1 because the server has completed the authentication, but the client authentication protocol %2 has not.\r\n
0x0000a004 | The Security System received an authentication attempt with an unknown authentication protocol. The request has failed.\r\n
0x0000a005 | The Security System has selected %2 for the authentication protocol to server %1.\r\n
0x0000a006 | The Security System has received an authentication attempt, and determined that the protocol %1 preferred by the client is acceptable.\r\n
0x0000a007 | The Security System has received an authentication request directly for authentication protocol %1.\r\n
0x0000a008 | The Security System has received an authentication request that could not be decoded. The request has failed.\r\n
0x0000a009 | The Security System has received an authentication attempt, and determined that the protocol %1 is the common protocol.\r\n
0x0000b000 | Logon cache was disabled. Intermittent authentication failures may result during periods of network latency or interrupts. Please contact your system administrator.\r\n
0x0000b001 | A failed logon attempt has caused a logon cache entry for user %1 to be deleted. The authentication package was %2, and the error message was %3.\r\n
0x0000b002 | A logon cache entry for user %1 was the oldest entry and was removed. The timestamp of this entry was %2.\r\n
0x01009020 | Verification of the DTLS connection request failed.\r\n
0x01009021 | DTLS record was rejected because it is outside of current receive window.\r\n
0x01009022 | A DTLS record was rejected because it is a duplicate of a previously received record.\r\n
0x01009023 | The retransmission of DTLS handshake messages has been requested.\r\n
0x01009030 | The key material used to protect TLS Session Tickets was not found at %1.\r\n
