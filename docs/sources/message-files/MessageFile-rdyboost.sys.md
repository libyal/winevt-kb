0xb0010011 | A ReadyBoost cache partially or fully failed to persist across boot. This may happen if the cache device was modified on another computer or if this computer was booted into another operating system.\r\n
0xb001001b | %1%n%nDevice name: %4%nCache path: %6\r\n
0xd0000001 | A memory corruption was detected and handled. Memory diagnostics should be run on this machine and, if necessary, memory chips should be replaced.\r\n
0xd0000002 | A data corruption was detected and handled in a ReadyBoost cache. This corruption was most likely caused by faulty hardware. While ReadyBoost will always detect and handle these errors, seeing a lot of these may mean that the ReadyBoost device has worn out which reduces its performance. You should consider replacing the ReadyBoost cache device.\r\n
0xd0000003 | A ReadyBoost cache was deleted due to repeated data corruption instances on the associated device that have been detected and handled. While ReadyBoost will always detect and handle these errors, repeated corruption instances may mean that the ReadyBoost device has worn out which reduces its performance. You should consider replacing the ReadyBoost device.\r\n
0xd0000004 | A ReadyBoost cache was deleted due to repeated I/O failures on the associated device. This typically happens when the device (e.g. an SD card) is removed, but it may also indicate faulty hardware.\r\n
