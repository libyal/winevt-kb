0x800006af | JetTerm2() cannot shutdown cleanly. Some ESE security databases may not be consistent and cannot be moved anywhere. Scesrv uses multiple databases and the log files could be referring to all of them. JetInit() will recover (if needed) all databases which are referred by the log files by looking at the database location as specified in the log files. This error will be seen if that location changed between the unclean shutdown indicated by JetTerm2() and the recovery moment. The logs and checkpoint located at %%windir%%\security should be deleted. \r\n
