0xc0001004 | The Active Directory global catalog cannot be accessed.\r\n
0xc0001005 | The Network Policy Server was unable to connect to a domain controller in the domain where the account is located. Because of this, authentication and authorization for the RADIUS request could not be performed.\r\n
0xc0001006 | The NPS server is unavailable because of low hardware resources or because it failed to receive the name of a domain controller, which can be due to a security accounts manager (SAM) database failure on the local computer or an NT directory service (NTDS) failure.\r\n
0xc0001007 | The specified domain does not exist.\r\n
0xc0001008 | The specified user account does not exist.\r\n
0xc0001009 | The request was discarded by a third-party extension DLL file.\r\n
0xc000100a | The request was discarded because an extension dll crashed or malfunctioned.\r\n
0xc0001010 | Authentication failed due to a user credentials mismatch. Either the user name provided does not map to an existing user account or the password was incorrect.\r\n
0xc0001011 | The user could not change his or her password because the new password did not meet the password requirements for this network.\r\n
0xc0001012 | The specified authentication type is not supported.\r\n
0xc0001013 | The user could not be authenticated using Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP). A reversibly encrypted password does not exist for this user account. To ensure that reversibly encrypted passwords are enabled, check either the domain password policy or the password settings on the user account.\r\n
0xc0001014 | LAN Manager authentication is not enabled.\r\n
0xc0001015 | An NPS extension dynamic link library (DLL) that is installed on the NPS server rejected the connection request.\r\n
0xc0001016 | The client could not be authenticated  because the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) Type cannot be processed by the server.\r\n
0xc0001017 | An error occurred during the Network Policy Server use of the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). Check EAP log files for EAP errors.\r\n
0xc0001020 | The Access-Request message contains a domain user name. NPS is joined to a workgroup and can process connection requests only for local user accounts.\r\n
0xc0001021 | The user must change his or her password.\r\n
0xc0001022 | The user or computer account that is specified in the RADIUS Access-Request message is disabled.\r\n
0xc0001023 | The user or computer account that is specified in the RADIUS Access-Request message is expired.\r\n
0xc0001024 | The user's authentication attempts have exceeded the maximum allowed number of failed attempts specified by the account lockout threshold setting in Account Lockout Policy in Group Policy. To unlock the account, edit the user account properties.\r\n
0xc0001025 | According to Active Directory user account logon hours, the user is not permitted to access the network on this day and time. To change the account logon hours, edit the user account properties in Active Directory.\r\n
0xc0001026 | Authentication failed due to a user account restriction or requirement that was not followed. For example, the user account settings might require the use of a password but the user attempted to log on with a blank password.\r\n
0xc0001030 | The connection request did not match any configured network policy.\r\n
0xc0001031 | The RADIUS request did not match any configured connection request policy (CRP).\r\n
0xc0001040 | Remote Access Account Lockout is enabled, and the user's authentication attempts have exceeded the designated lockout count because the credentials they supplied (user name and password) are not valid. The user account will be removed from the locked out list on successful authentication or on the expiration of the configured lockout time. To manually reset a locked out account, delete the registry subkey  that corresponds to the user account name: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RemoteAccess\Parameters\AccountLockout\domain name:user name\r\n
0xc0001041 | The Network Access Permission setting in the dial-in properties of the user account in Active Directory is set to Deny access to the user. To change the Network Access Permission setting to either Allow access or Control access through NPS Network Policy, obtain the properties of the user account in Active Directory Users and Computers, click the Dial-in tab, and change Network Access Permission.\r\n
0xc0001042 | The user attempted to use an authentication method that is not enabled on the matching network policy.\r\n
0xc0001043 | The user attempted to connect through either a phone number or calling station that does not match the Caller ID listed for the user account.\r\n
0xc0001044 | The user or computer does not have permission to access the network on this day at this time. To change the day and time when the user is permitted to connect to the network, change the Day and Time Restrictions in the constraints of the matching network policy.\r\n
0xc0001045 | The telephone number of the network access server does not match the value of the Called-Station-ID attribute that is configured in the constraints of the matching network policy. NPS denied the Access-Request.\r\n
0xc0001046 | The network access method used by the access client to connect to the network does not match the value of the NAS-Port-Type attribute that is configured in the constraints of the matching network policy.\r\n
0xc0001047 |  \r\n
0xc0001048 | The user's password has expired or is about to expire and the user must change it, but the change password option is not enabled for the matching network policy.\r\n
0xc0001049 | The user attempted to authenticate using a certificate with an Extended Key Usage or Issuance Policy that is not allowed by the matching network policy.\r\n
0xc0001050 | The authentication or accounting record could not be written to the configured accounting datastore. Ensure that the log file location is accessible, has available space, can be written to, and that the directory or SQL server is available.\r\n
0xc0001060 | Authentication failed due to an EAP session timeout; the EAP session with the access client was incomplete.\r\n
0xc0001061 | The authentication request was not processed because it contained a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) message that was not appropriate for the secure authentication transaction.\r\n
0xc0001070 | The remote RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) server did not process the authentication request.\r\n
0xc0001071 | The remote RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) server group does not exist.\r\n
0xc0001072 | The authentication request could not be forwarded to the remote RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) server because this server is no longer configured from the local server.\r\n
0xc0001073 | The RADIUS request could not be forwarded to the RADIUS server because the issued packet was invalid.\r\n
0xc0001074 | The local NPS proxy server cannot forward the connection request to the remote RADIUS server because network problems caused a Windows socket error.\r\n
0xc0001075 | The remote RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) server did not respond.\r\n
0xc0001076 | The local NPS proxy server received a RADIUS message that is malformed from a remote RADIUS server, and the message is unreadable. This issue can also be caused if a connection request contains more than the expected number of user-name attributes, or if the user-name attribute value is not valid, such as if the value has zero length or if it contains characters that are not valid.\r\n
