0x00000001 | \r\nWindows System Assessment Tool\r\n\r\n    \r\nCOMMAND LINE USAGE :   \r\n    WINSAT <assessment_name> [switches]\r\n\r\nIt's necessary to supply an assessment name.  In contrast, switches are optional. \r\nValid assessment names already seen in Vista include: \r\n\r\n    formal\t\trun the full set of assessments \r\n\r\n    dwm\t\tRun the Desktop Windows Manager assessment\r\n            - Re-assess the systems graphics capabilities and \r\n              restart the Desktop Window Manager.\r\n\r\n    cpu\t\tRun the CPU assessment.  \r\n    mem\t\tRun the system memory assessment.  \r\n    d3d\t\tRun the d3d assessment \r\n                (Note that the d3d assessment no longer runs the workload. \r\n                For backward compatibility, pre-determined scores and metrics are reported.)\r\n    disk\t\tRun the storage assessment\r\n    media\t\tRun the media assessment \t\t\t\r\n    mfmedia\t\tRun the Media Foundation based assessment\t\r\n    features\tRun just the features assessment      \t\t\r\n            - Enumerates the system's features. \r\n            - It's best used with the -xml <filename> switch \r\n            to save the data.  \r\n            - The 'eef'switch can be used to enumerate extra \r\n            features such as optical disks,\tmemory modules, \r\n            and other items.\r\n    \r\nPRE-POPULATION: \r\nThe new command-line  options for pre-populating WinSAT assessment results are :  \r\n    \r\n    Winsat prepop [-datastore <directory>] [ -graphics | -cpu | -mem | -disk | -dwm ]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis generates WinSAT xml files whose filenames contain "prepop".  For example :\r\n    0008-09-26 14.48.28.542 Cpu.Assessment (Prepop).WinSAT.xml\r\n\r\nThe filename pattern is :\t\r\n    %IdentifierDerivedFromDate% %Component%.Assessment(Prepop).WinSAT.xml\r\n\r\nThe datastore directory option specifies an alternative target location for generated xml files. \r\nIf no location is specified, everything is pre-populated to \r\n    %WINDIR%\performance\winsat\datastore.  \r\n\r\nTo generate a full set of result xml files, use "winsat prepop".  \r\n\r\nIt is also possible to pre-populate results for a subsystem, such as CPU, \r\nsubject to the following dependencies:\r\n\r\n    The CPU assessment has a secondary dependency on the Memory assessment\r\n    The Memory assessment has a secondary dependency on the CPU assessment\r\n    The Graphics assessment has a secondary dependency on both CPU and Memory assessments\r\n    The DWM assessment can run standalone\r\n    The Disk assessment can run standalone \r\n\r\nIf the assessment for a secondary dependency is not present, WinSAT will run the \r\nsecondary assessment along with the requested primary assessment.  \r\n\r\nFor example,  "winsat prepop -cpu"  will run both the CPU and the Memory test, \r\nif the xml file for the Memory test is not present.\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER NEW Win7 ASSESSMENT OPTIONS :\r\n\r\n    dwmformal\tRun Desktop Windows Manager assessment to generate the WinSAT Graphics score\r\n    cpuformal\tRun CPU assessment to generate the WinSAT Processor score\r\n    memformal\tRun Memory assessment to generate the WinSAT Memory (RAM) score\r\n    graphicsformal\tRun Graphics assessment to generate the WinSAT Gaming Graphics score\r\n    diskformal\tRun Disk assessment to generate the WinSAT Primary Hard Disk score\r\n            \r\nAll formal assessments will save the data (xml files) in \r\n        %WINDIR%\performance\winsat\datastore.  \r\n\r\nIf a system has been prepopulated (using files generated by the "winsat prepop" option), \r\nit is not necessary to run formal assessments.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUB-ASSESSMENTS:\r\nWhile investigating results, it may be convenient to look at individual assessments.  \r\nOptions for running Gaming Graphics sub-assessments include:\r\n\r\n    Winsat graphicsformal3d\r\n    Winsat graphicsformalmedia\r\n\r\n    DX9 Variations:  \r\n        Winsat d3d -dx9\r\n        winsat d3d -batch\r\n        winsat d3d -alpha\r\n        winsat d3d -tex\r\n        winsat d3d -alu\r\n\r\n    DWM/DX10 variations:  \r\n        Winsat d3d -dx10\r\n        winsat d3d -dx10 -alpha\r\n        winsat d3d -dx10 -tex\r\n        winsat d3d -dx10 -alu\r\n        winsat d3d -dx10 -batch\r\n        winsat d3d -dx10 -geomf4\r\n        winsat d3d -dx10 -geomf27\r\n        winsat d3d -dx10 -geomv8\r\n        winsat d3d -dx10 -gemov32\r\n        winsat d3d -dx10 -cbuffer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPTIONS FOR FORMAL ASSESSMENTS FOR SUBSEQUENT RUNS ON THE SAME MACHINE:\r\n\r\nThe default behavior for "WinSAT formal" when a complete set of winsat formal files is present \r\nand a second "winsat formal" run is requested is to \r\n    1) Run incrementally if component change implies that an assessment needs to be re-run, \r\n        e.g. if a video card were updated  \r\n    2) If no component updates were detected, re-run all assessments.\r\n\r\n    The restart option enables behavior other than the default.  The syntax is :   \t\r\n        Winsat formal -restart [clean|never]\r\n    \r\n        Winsat formal -restart\t \tReruns all assessments. \r\n        Winsat formal -restart never \tAttempts to run incrementally.\r\n        Winsat formal -restart clean \tReruns all assessments and provides the same functionality as "forgethistory". \r\n        Winsat forgethistory\t\tChoosing to forgethistory will rate a machine as if for the first time.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER COMMAND LINE OPTIONS :\r\n    -v\t\t\tEnables verbose output\r\n    -xml\t\t\tSaves the XML output to 'filename'\r\n\r\n    <command> -log <fn>\tGenerates a log file associated with the specified command, such as disk\r\n                The -log switch can be used with any WinSAT command.\r\n\r\n    viewlog -i <filename> \tDumps the results of a log file .  \r\n    viewevents \t\tUsed to view relevant winsat events in the event log. \r\n                (This launches the event log)\r\n    query \t\t\tCan be used to query the current datastore.\r\n
