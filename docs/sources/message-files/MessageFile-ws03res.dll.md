Initial synchronization is the first early replications done by a system as it is starting. A failure to initially synchronize may explain why a FSMO role cannot be validated.

Use the command repadmin /showrepl to display the replication errors.  Correct the error\r\nin question. For example there maybe problems with IP connectivity, DNS name resolution, or\r\nsecurity authentication that are preventing successful replication.\r\n%n3. In the rare event that all replication partners being down is an expected occurance, perhaps because of maintenance or a disaster recovery, you can force the role to be validated.

If the FSMO role holder server used to be a domain controller, but was not demoted successfully,\r\nthen the objects\r\nrepresenting that server are still in the forest. This can occur if a domain controller has its\r\noperating system reinstalled or if a forced removal is performed.  These lingering state objects\r\nshould be removed using the NTDSUTIL.EXE metadata cleanup function.\r\n%n4. The FSMO role holder may not be a direct replication partner.

Replication is blocked somewhere along the path of servers between the FSMO role holder\r\nserver and this server.  Consult your forest topology plan to determine the likely route for\r\nreplication between these servers.
