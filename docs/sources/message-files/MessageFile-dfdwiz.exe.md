0xb0000001 | Windows Disk Diagnostic detected a S.M.A.R.T. fault on disk %1 (volumes %2).  This disk might fail; back up your computer now. All data on the hard disk, including files, documents, pictures, programs, and settings might be lost if your hard disk fails.  To determine if the hard disk needs to be repaired or replaced, contact the manufacturer of your computer.

In the meantime, do not save any critical files to this disk.\r\n
