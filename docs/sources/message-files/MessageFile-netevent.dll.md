0x8000251f | The value for the %2 parameter %3 was illegal.\r\n
0x80002b2a | The DNS Client service could not contact any DNS servers for\r\na repeated number of attempts. For the next %3 seconds the\r\nDNS Client service will not use the network to avoid further\r\nnetwork performance problems. It will resume its normal behavior\r\nafter that. If this problem persists, verify your TCP/IP\r\nconfiguration, specifically check that you have a preferred\r\n(and possibly an alternate) DNS server configured. If the problem\r\ncontinues, verify network conditions to these DNS servers or contact\r\nyour network administrator.\r\n

0x80002b8e | The system failed to register network adapter with settings:%n%n\r\n  Adapter Name : %1%n\r\n  Host Name : %2%n\r\n  Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : %3%n\r\n  DNS Server list :%n\r\n    %4%n\r\n  Sent update to server : %5%n\r\n  IP Address(es) :%n\r\n    %6%n%n\r\nThe cause of this DNS registration failure was because the DNS update\r\nrequest timed out after being sent to the specified DNS Server. This is\r\nprobably because the authoritative DNS server for the name being updated\r\nis not running.%n%n You can manually retry registration of the network\r\nadapter and its settings by typing "ipconfig /registerdns" at the command\r\nprompt. If problems still  persist, contact your network systems\r\nadministrator to verify network conditions.\r\n
0x80002b8f | The system failed to register network adapter with settings:%n%n\r\n  Adapter Name : %1%n\r\n  Host Name : %2%n\r\n  Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : %3%n\r\n  DNS server list :%n\r\n    %4%n\r\n  Sent update to server : %5%n\r\n  IP Address(es) :%n\r\n    %6%n%n\r\nThe cause of this DNS registration failure was because of DNS server failure.\r\nThis may be due to a zone transfer that has locked the DNS server for the\r\napplicable zone that your computer needs to register itself with.%n%n\r\n(The applicable zone should typically correspond to the Adapter-specific\r\nDomain Suffix that was indicated above.) You can manually retry registration\r\nof the network adapter and its settings by typing "ipconfig /registerdns"\r\nat the command prompt. If problems still persist, contact your network\r\nsystems administrator to verify network conditions.\r\n
0x80002b90 | The system failed to register network adapter with settings:%n%n\r\n  Adapter Name : %1%n\r\n  Host Name : %2%n\r\n  Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : %3%n\r\n  DNS server list :%n\r\n    %4%n\r\n  Sent update to server : %5%n\r\n  IP Address(es) :%n\r\n    %6%n%n\r\nThe reason it could not register was because either: (a) the DNS server\r\ndoes not support the DNS dynamic update protocol, or (b) the primary zone\r\nauthoritative for the registering names does not currently accept dynamic\r\nupdates.%n%n To add or register a DNS host (A) resource record using the\r\nspecific DNS name for this adapter, contact your DNS server or network\r\nsystems administrator.\r\n
0x80002b91 | The system failed to register network adapter with settings:%n%n\r\n  Adapter Name : %1%n\r\n  Host Name : %2%n\r\n  Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : %3%n\r\n  DNS server list :%n\r\n    %4%n\r\n  Sent update to server : %5%n\r\n  IP Address(es) :%n\r\n    %6%n%n\r\nThe reason it could not register was because the DNS server refused the\r\ndynamic update request. This could happen for the following reasons:\r\n(a) current DNS update policies do not allow this computer to update\r\nthe DNS domain name configured for this adapter, or (b) the authoritative\r\nDNS server for this DNS domain name does not support the DNS dynamic update\r\nprotocol.%n%n\r\nTo register a DNS host (A) resource record using the specific DNS domain\r\nname for this adapter, contact your DNS server or network systems\r\nadministrator.\r\n
0x80002b92 | The system failed to register network adapter with settings:%n%n\r\n  Adapter Name : %1%n\r\n  Host Name : %2%n\r\n  Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : %3%n\r\n  DNS server list :%n\r\n    %4%n\r\n  Sent update to server : %5%n\r\n  IP Address(es) :%n\r\n    %6%n%n\r\nThe system could not register the DNS update request because of a\r\nsecurity related problem. This could happen for the following reasons:\r\n(a) the DNS domain name that your computer is trying to register could\r\nnot be updated because your computer does not have the right permissions,\r\nor (b) there might have been a problem negotiating valid credentials\r\nwith the DNS server to update.%n%n\r\nYou can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and its\r\nsettings by typing "ipconfig /registerdns" at the command prompt. If\r\nproblems still persist, contact your DNS server or network systems\r\nadministrator. For specific error code information, see the record data\r\ndisplayed below.\r\n
0x80002b93 | The system failed to register network adapter with settings:%n%n\r\n  Adapter Name : %1%n\r\n  Host Name : %2%n\r\n  Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : %3%n\r\n  DNS server list :%n\r\n    %4%n\r\n  Sent update to server : %5%n\r\n  IP Address(es) :%n\r\n    %6%n%n\r\nThe reason the DNS update request could not be completed was because\r\nof a system problem.
