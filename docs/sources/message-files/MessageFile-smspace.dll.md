0x00000001 | Data is striped across physical disks, maximizing capacity and increasing throughput, but decreasing reliability. This storage layout requires at least one disk and does not protect you from a disk failure.%0\r\n
0x00000002 | Data is duplicated on two or three physical disks, increasing reliability, but reducing capacity. This storage layout requires at least two disks to protect you from a single disk failure, or at least five disks to protect you from two simultaneous disk failures.%0\r\n
0x00000003 | Data and parity information are striped across physical disks, increasing reliability, but somewhat reducing capacity. This storage layout requires at least three disks to protect you from a single disk failure, and cannot be used in a failover cluster.%0\r\n
