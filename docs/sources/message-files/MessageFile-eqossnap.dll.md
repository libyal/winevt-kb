0xb000000c | Selective application of legacy QoS policies based on domain or non-domain network category has been disabled on this machine. QoS policies will be applied to all network interfaces.\r\n
0xb000000d | In the past %1 hour(s) and %2 minute(s), %3 HTTP.SYS responses have had their application requested QoS conflict with URL QoS policies.\r\n
0xb0000064 | There is at least one policy containing minimum bandwidth specification and at least one other policy that does not. It is generally not a good idea to mix these two classes of policies on the same system.\r\n
0xb0000066 | A %1 QoS policy "%2" has an invalid version number. This policy will not be applied.\r\n
0xb0000068 | A %1 QoS policy "%2" does not specify a QoS parameter (e.g. DSCP value, throttle rate, etc.) This policy will not be applied.\r\n
0xb000006c | A %1 QoS policy "%2" potentially conflicts with other QoS policies. See documentation for rules about which policy will be applied at packet send time.\r\n
0xb000006e | A %1 QoS policy "%2" was ignored because the application path could not be processed. The application path may be totally invalid, or has an invalid drive letter, or contains network-mapped drive letter.\r\n
0xb00000c8 | %1 QoS policies failed to refresh. Error code: %2\r\n
0xb00000cc | A %1 QoS policy exceeds the maximum allowed name length. The offending policy is listed under the relevant policy root key with index %2.\r\n
0xb00000ce | A %1 QoS policy has a zero length name. The offending policy is listed under the relevant policy root key with index %2.\r\n
0xb00000d0 | Failed to open the registry subkey for a %1 QoS policy. The policy is listed under the relevant policy root key with index %2.\r\n

0xd0000003 | Setting value is not specified by any QoS policy. Local computer default will be applied.\r\n

0xd0000007 | Setting value is Level 3 (maximum throughput).\r\n
0xd0000008 | Setting value is not specified by any QoS policy. Local computer default will be applied. By default, applications can set DSCP values independently of QoS policies.\r\n
0xd0000009 | Application DSCP marking requests will be ignored. Only QoS policies can set DSCP values.\r\n
