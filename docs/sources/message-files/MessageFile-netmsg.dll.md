0x00001691 | Netlogon got the following error while trying to get the subnet to site\r\nmapping information from the DS: %n%1\r\n
0x00001692 | '%1' tried to determine its site by looking up its IP address ('%2')\r\nin the Configuration\Sites\Subnets container in the DS.  No subnet matched\r\nthe IP address.  Consider adding a subnet object for this IP address.\r\n
0x00001693 | The site name for this computer is '%1'.  That site name is not a valid\r\nsite name.  A site name must be a valid DNS label.\r\nRename the site to be a valid name.\r\n
0x00001694 | The subnet object '%1' appears in the Configuration\Sites\Subnets\r\ncontainer in the DS.  The name is not syntactically valid.  The valid\r\nsyntax is xx.xx.xx.xx/yy where xx.xx.xx.xx is a valid IP subnet number\r\nand yy is the number of bits in the subnet mask.\r\n\r\nCorrect the name of the subnet object.\r\n
0x00001695 | Dynamic registration or deletion of one or more DNS records associated with DNS\r\ndomain '%1' failed.  These records are used by other computers to locate this\r\nserver as a domain controller (if the specified domain is an Active Directory\r\ndomain) or as an LDAP server (if the specified domain is an application partition).\r\n\r\n%n%nPossible causes of failure include:\r\n\r\n%n- TCP/IP properties of the network connections of this computer contain wrong IP address(es) of the preferred and alternate DNS servers\r\n%n- Specified preferred and alternate DNS servers are not running\r\n%n- DNS server(s) primary for the records to be registered is not running\r\n%n- Preferred or alternate DNS servers are configured with wrong root hints\r\n%n- Parent DNS zone contains incorrect delegation to the child zone authoritative for the DNS records that failed registration\r\n\r\n%n%nUSER ACTION\r\n\r\n%nFix possible misconfiguration(s) specified above and initiate registration or deletion of\r\nthe DNS records by running 'nltest.exe /dsregdns' from the command prompt or by restarting\r\nNet Logon service.

0x000016a8 | Attempt to update DnsHostName and HOST Service Principal Name (SPN) attributes\r\nof the computer object in Active Directory failed because the Domain Controller\r\n'%1' had more than one account with the name '%2' corresponding to this computer.\r\nNot having SPNs registered may result in authentication failures for this computer.\r\nContact your domain administrator who may need to manually resolve the account name\r\ncollision.\r\n
0x000016a9 | Attempt to update DnsHostName and HOST Service Principal Name (SPN) attributes\r\nof the computer object in Active Directory failed because this computer account\r\nname, '%2' could not be mapped to the computer object on Domain Controller '%1'.\r\nNot having SPNs registered may result in authentication failures for this computer.\r\nContact your domain administrator. The following technical information may be\r\nuseful for the resolution of this failure:%n\r\nDsCrackNames status = 0x%3, crack error = 0x%4.\r\n
0x000016aa | None of the IP addresses (%2) of this Domain Controller map to the configured site '%1'.\r\nWhile this may be a temporary situation due to IP address changes, it is generally\r\nrecommended that the IP address of the Domain Controller (accessible to machines in\r\nits domain) maps to the Site which it services. If the above list of IP addresses is\r\nstable, consider moving this server to a site (or create one if it does not already\r\nexist) such that the above IP address maps to the selected site. This may require the\r\ncreation of a new subnet object (whose range includes the above IP address) which maps\r\nto the selected site object.\r\n
0x000016ab | The following error occurred while reading a parameter '%2' in the\r\nNetlogon %1 registry section:%n%3\r\n
0x000016ac | The Netlogon %1 registry key contains an invalid value 0x%2 for parameter '%3'.\r\nThe minimum and maximum values allowed for this parameter are 0x%4 and 0x%5, respectively.\r\nThe value of 0x%6 has been assigned to this parameter.\r\n
0x000016ad | The session setup from the computer %1 failed to authenticate.\r\nThe following error occurred: %n%2\r\n
0x000016ae | Dynamic DNS updates have been manually disabled on this domain controller.\r\n\r\n%n%nUSER ACTION\r\n\r\n%nReconfigure this domain controller to use dynamic DNS updates or manually add the DNS\r\nrecords from the file '%SystemRoot%\System32\Config\Netlogon.dns' to the DNS database.\r\n
0x000016af | During the past %1 hours there have been %2 connections to this Domain\r\nController from client machines whose IP addresses don't map to any of\r\nthe existing sites in the enterprise. Those clients, therefore, have\r\nundefined sites and may connect to any Domain Controller including\r\nthose that are in far distant locations from the clients. A client's site\r\nis determined by the mapping of its subnet to one of the existing sites.\r\nTo move the above clients to one of the sites, please consider creating\r\nsubnet object(s) covering the above IP addresses with mapping to one of the\r\nexisting sites.  The names and IP addresses of the clients in question have\r\nbeen logged on this computer in the following log file\r\n'%SystemRoot%\debug\netlogon.log' and, potentially, in the log file\r\n'%SystemRoot%\debug\netlogon.bak' created if the former log becomes full.\r\nThe log(s) may contain additional unrelated debugging information. To filter\r\nout the needed information, please search for lines which contain text\r\n'NO_CLIENT_SITE:'. The first word after this string is the client name and\r\nthe second word is the client IP address. The maximum size of the log(s) is\r\ncontrolled by the following registry DWORD value\r\n'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters\LogFileMaxSize';\r\nthe default is %3 bytes.  The current maximum size is %4 bytes.  To set a\r\ndifferent maximum size, create the above registry value and set the desired\r\nmaximum size in bytes.\r\n
0x000016b0 | The deregistration of some DNS domain controller locator records was aborted\r\nat the time of this domain controller demotion because the DNS deregistrations\r\ntook too long.\r\n\r\n%n%nUSER ACTION\r\n\r\n%nManually delete the DNS records listed in the file\r\n'%SystemRoot%\System32\Config\Netlogon.dns' from the DNS database.\r\n
0x000016b1 | The NetLogon service on this domain controller has been configured to use port %1\r\nfor incoming RPC connections over TCP/IP from remote machines. However, the\r\nfollowing error occurred when Netlogon attempted to register this port with the RPC\r\nendpoint mapper service: %n%2 %nThis will prevent the NetLogon service on remote\r\nmachines from connecting to this domain controller over TCP/IP that may result in\r\nauthentication problems.\r\n\r\n%n%nUSER ACTION\r\n\r\n%nThe specified port is configured via the Group Policy or via a registry value 'DcTcpipPort'\r\nunder the 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters'\r\nregistry key; the value configured through the Group Policy takes precedence. If the\r\nport specified is in error, reset it to a correct value. You can also remove this\r\nconfiguration for the port in which case the port will be assigned dynamically by\r\nthe endpoint mapper at the time the NetLogon service on remote machines makes RPC connections\r\nto this domain controller. After the misconfiguration is corrected, restart the NetLogon\r\nservice on this machine and verify that this event log no longer appears.\r\n

If the\r\nport specified is in error, reset it to a correct value. You can also remove this\r\nconfiguration for the port in which case the port will be assigned dynamically by\r\nthe endpoint mapper at the time the NetLogon service on remote machines makes RPC connections\r\nto this domain controller.

0x000016b2 | During the past %1 hours, this domain controller has received %2 connections\r\nfrom dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 clients with partial subnet-site mappings. A client\r\nhas a partial subnet-site mapping if its IPv4 address is mapped to a site but\r\nits global IPv6 address is not mapped to a site, or vice versa. To ensure correct\r\nbehavior for applications running on member computers and servers that rely on\r\nsubnet-site mappings, dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 clients must have both IPv4 and global\r\nIPv6 addresses mapped to the same site. If a partially mapped client attempts\r\nto connect to this domain controller using its unmapped IP address, its mapped\r\naddress is used for the client's site mapping.\r\n\r\n%n%nThe log files %SystemRoot%\debug\netlogon.log or %SystemRoot%\debug\netlogon.bak\r\ncontain the name, unmapped IP address and mapped IP address for each partially\r\nmapped client. The log files may also contain unrelated debugging information.\r\nTo locate the information pertaining to partial-subnet mappings, search for\r\nlines that contain the text 'PARTIAL_CLIENT_SITE_MAPPING:'. The first word after\r\nthis text is the client name. Following the client name is the client's unmapped\r\nIP address (the IP address that does not have a subnet-site mapping) and the\r\nclient's mapped IP address, which was used to return site information.\r\n\r\n%n%nUSER ACTION\r\n\r\n%nUse the Active Directory Sites and Services management console (MMC) snap-in\r\nto add the subnet mapping for the unmapped IP addresses to the same site being\r\nused by the mapped IP addresses. When adding site mappings for IPv6 addresses,\r\nyou should use global IPv6 addresses and not for instance temporary, link-local\r\nor site-local IPv6 addresses.\r\n\r\n%n%nThe default maximum size of the log files is %3 bytes. The current maximum\r\nsize is %4 bytes. To set a different maximum size, create the following registry\r\nDWORD value to specify the maximum size in bytes:\r\n\r\n%nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters\LogFileMaxSize\r\n
