Message identifier | Message string
--- | ---
0x40440010 | An audio format implemented by device %1 is not supported by the driver. The format was ignored.\r\n
0x80440020 | A feedback endpoint implemented by device %1 is unusable because its bInterval value is not supported. Audio glitches might occur.\r\n
0x80440021 | An IN endpoint with adaptive synchronization implemented by device %1 will be handled like asynchronous synchronization.\r\n
0xc0440010 | A system call failed. The specific status code is contained in this event.\r\n
0xc0440011 | The device %1 does not implement any audio format supported by the driver.\r\n
0xc0440020 | Device %1 is operating at a USB speed that is not supported by the driver.\r\n
0xc0440021 | A USB descriptor reported by device %1 has an invalid length.\r\n
0xc0440022 | A USB descriptor reported by device %1 is not compliant with the specification, or is not supported by the driver.\r\n
0xc0440023 | The audio function topology implemented by device %1 is not compliant with the specification, or is not supported by the driver.\r\n
0xc0440024 | The channel count of at least one path in the audio function topology of device %1 cannot be determined.\r\n
0xc0440025 | The driver could not find a feedback endpoint for an asynchronous data OUT endpoint on device %1.\r\n
0xc0440026 | A control request sent to device %1 has failed.\r\n
0xc0440027 | A control request sent to device %1 has timed out. The device took too long to respond.\r\n
0xc0440028 | In response to a control request, the device %1 returned an invalid value or an invalid length.\r\n
