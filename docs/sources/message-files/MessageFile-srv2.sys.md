0xb00002be | SMB2 Share Deleted\r\n
0xb00003e8 | S4U2Self authentication failure - The client could not be reauthenticated with S4U2Self to obtain claims.  This may be expected if the account is not a domain account.\r\n

0xb00003eb | The server received an unencrypted message from client %4. Message was rejected.%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that a client is sending unencrypted data even though the SMB share requires encryption.\r\n
0xb00003ec | The server received an incorrectly signed message from client %2. Message was rejected.%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that a client is sending an incorrectly signed request.\r\n
0xb00003ed | The server failed to validate negotiation from client %2. Connection was terminated.\r\n
0xb00003ee | The share denied access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %10%nClient Address: %6%nUser Name: %8%nSession ID: %17%nShare Name: %2%nShare Path: %4%nStatus: %16 (%15)%nMapped Access: %11%nGranted Access: %12%nSecurity Descriptor: %14%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect access denied errors when a principal accesses a share without the necessary permissions. Usually, this indicates that the principal does not have direct security permissions or lacks membership in a group that has direct access permissions. To determine and correct the permissions on the specified share, an administrator can use the Security tab in File Explorer Properties dialog, the SMBSHARE Windows PowerShell module, or the NET SHARE command. You can also use the Effective Access tab in File Explorer to help diagnose the issue.%n%nApplications may generate access denied errors if they attempt to open files in a writable mode first, and then reopen the files in a read-only mode. In this case, no user action is required.%n%nIf access to the share is denied and this event is not logged, you can examine the file and folder NTFS/REFS permissions.%n%nThis error does not indicate a problem with authentication, only authorization.\r\n
0xb00003ef | The share denied anonymous access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %8%nClient Address: %6%nShare Name: %2%nShare Path: %4%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when a client attempts to connect to shares and does not provide any credentials. This indicates that the client is not providing a user name (and domain credentials, if necessary). By default, anonymous access to shares is denied.%n%nThis error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.\r\n
0xb00003f1 | The server denied anonymous access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %4%n Client Address: %2%nSession ID: %5%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when a client attempts to connect to shares and does not provide any credentials. This indicates that the client is not providing a user name (and domain credentials, if necessary). By default, Windows Server denies anonymous access to shares.%n%nThis error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.\r\n
0xb00003f2 | Endpoint added.%n%nName: %2%nDomain Name: %4%nTransport Name: %6%nTransport Flags: %7%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when the server starts listening on an interface, such as during system restart or when enabling a network adaptor. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f3 | Endpoint removed.%n%nName: %2%nDomain Name: %4%nTransport Name: %6%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when the server stops listening on an interface, such as during shutdown or when disabling a network adaptor. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f4 | The network name information changed.%n%nChange Type: %1%nNet Name: %3%nIP Address: %9%nFlags: %4%nInterface Index: %5%nCapability: %6%nLink Speed: %7%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event on a Windows Failover Cluster node during failover operations, at system startup, or during network configuration. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f5 | Endpoint coming online.%n%nEndpoint Name: %2%nTransport Name: %4%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event on a Windows Failover Cluster node during failover operations. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f6 | Endpoint going offline.%n%nEndpoint Name: %2%nTransport Name: %4%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event on a Windows Failover Cluster node during failover operations. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f7 | Decrypt call failed.%n%nClient Name: %2%nClient Address: %4%nSession ID: %7%nStatus: %6 (%5)%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event commonly occurs because a previous SMB session no longer exists. It may also be caused by packets that are altered on the network between the computers due to either errors or a "man-in-the-middle" attack.\r\n
0xb00003f8 | Reopen failed.%n%nClient Name: %7%nClient Address: %9%nUser Name: %13%nSession ID: %14%nShare Name: %11%nFile Name: %16%nResume Key: %20%nStatus: %2 (%1)%nRKF Status: %4 (%3)%nDurable: %17%nResilient: %18%nPersistent: %19%nReason: %21%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe client attempted to reopen a continuously available handle, but the attempt failed. This typically indicates a problem with the network or underlying file being re-opened.\r\n
0xb00003f9 | Handle scavenged.%n%nShare Name: %7%nFile Name: %9%nResume Key: %5%nPersistent File ID: %3%nVolatile File ID: %4%nDurable: %1%nResilient or Persistent: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server closed a handle that was previously reserved for a client after 60 seconds. You should expect this event on a computer that is continuously available where a client did not gracefully close its session. For instance, this may occur when the client unexpectedly restarted.\r\n
0xb00003fa | Backchannel invalidation of session completed.%n%nSession ID: %1%nStatus: %3 (%2)%nTask Status: %5 (%4)%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event on a computer that is continuously available. No user action is required\r\n
0xb00003fb | Backchannel invalidation of file completed.%n%nResume Key: %1%nStatus: %3 (%2)%nTask Status: %5 (%4)%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event on a computer that is continuously available. No user action is required\r\n
0xb00003fc | File system operation has taken longer than expected.%n%nClient Name: %8%nClient Address: %10%nUser Name: %6%nSession ID: %3%nShare Name: %12%nFile Name: %14%nCommand: %1%nDuration (in milliseconds): %15%nWarning Threshold (in milliseconds): %16%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe underlying file system has taken too long to respond to an operation. This typically indicates a problem with the storage and not SMB.\r\n
0xb00003fd | LmCompatibilityLevel value is different from the default.%n%nConfigured LM Compatibility Level: %1%nDefault LM Compatibility Level: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nLAN Manager (LM) authentication is the protocol used to authenticate Windows clients for network operations. This includes joining a domain, accessing network resources, and authenticating users or computers. This determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is negotiated between the client and the server computers. Specifically, the LM authentication level determines which authentication protocols the client will try to negotiate or the server will accept. The value set for LmCompatibilityLevel determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This value affects the level of authentication protocol that clients use, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.%n%nValue (Setting) - Description%n%n0 (Send LM & NTLM responses) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n1 (Send LM & NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n2 (Send NTLM response only) - Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n3 (Send NTLM v2 response only) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n4 (Send NTLMv2 response only/refuse LM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n5 (Send NTLM v2 response only/refuse LM & NTLM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM and accept only NTLMv2 authentication.%n%nIncompatibly configured  LmCompatibility levels between a client and server (such as 0 on a client and 5 on a server) prevent access to the server. Non-Microsoft clients and servers also provide these configuration settings.\r\n
0xb00003fe | File and printer sharing firewall rule enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that has custom shares configured.\r\n
0xb00003ff | One or more shares present on this server have access based enumeration enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when enabling access-based enumeration on one or more shares by using either Server Manager or the Set-SmbShare Windows PowerShell cmdlet. Access-based enumeration can raise CPU utilization when clients connect to shares with folders containing many peer-level resources to which a user does not have access. You can control the CPU utilization by configuring the ABELevel value in the Windows registry:%n%nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\ABELevel [DWORD]%n%nYou can set the value for ABELevel to greater depths to minimize CPU overhead, but doing so diminishes the effectiveness of access-based enumeration:%n%nValue = 0: access-based enumeration is enabled for all levels%n%nValue = 1: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 1 (example: \server\share)%n%nValue = 2: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 2 (example: \server\share\folder)%n%nYou can continue setting values for multiple depth levels.\r\n
0xb0000400 | SMB2 and SMB3 have been disabled on this server.  This results in reduced functionality and performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: Smb2%nDefault Value: 1 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: 0%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB2/SMB3. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB2/SMB3. When SMB3 is disabled, you cannot use features such as SMB Transparent Failover, SMB Scale Out, SMB Multichannel, SMB Direct (RDMA), SMB Encryption, VSS for SMB file shares, and SMB Directory Leasing. In most scenarios, SMB provides a troubleshooting workaround as an alternative to disabling SMB2/SMB3. Use the Set-SmbServerConfiguration Windows PowerShell cmdlet to enable SMB2/SMB3.\r\n
0xb0000401 | One or more named pipes or shares have been marked for access by anonymous users.  This increases the security risk of the computer by allowing unauthenticated users to connect to this server.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Values: NullSessionPipes, NullSessionShares%nDefault Value: Empty (or not present)%nCurrent Value: Non-empty%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when modifying the default values of NullSessionShares and NullSessionPipes. On a typical file server, these settings do not exist or do not contain values, which is the most secure configuration. By default, domain controllers populate the NullSessionShares entry with netlogon, samr, and lsarpc to allow legacy access methods.\r\n
0xb0000402 | File leasing has been disabled for the SMB2 and SMB3 protocols.  This reduces functionality and can decrease performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: DisableLeasing%nDefault Value: 0 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: non-zero%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB 3 Leasing. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB Leasing. Once disabled, traffic from client to server may increase since metadata and data may no longer be retrieved from a local cache.\r\n
0xb0000403 | The file and printer sharing firewall ports are currently closed.  This is the default configuration for a system that is not sharing content or is on a Public network.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is not configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that does not have custom shares configured. Clients cannot access SMB shares on this computer until SMB traffic is allowed through the firewall.\r\n
0xb0000708 | CA failure - Failed to set continuously available property on a new or existing file share as the file share is not a cluster share.\r\n
0xb0000709 | CA failure - Failed to set continuously available property on a new or existing file share as Resume Key filter is not started or has failed to attach to the underlying volume.\r\n
0xb000070a | The server failed to reserve the next ID region in the cluster registry.\r\n

0xb0010227 | SMB Session Authentication Failure%n%nClient Name: %11%nClient Address: %6%nUser Name: %9%nSession ID: %7%nStatus: %4 (%3)%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when attempting to connect to shares using incorrect credentials.%n%nThis error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.%n%nThis error can occur when using incorrect usernames and passwords with NTLM, mismatched LmCompatibility settings between client and server, duplicate Kerberos service principal names, incorrect Kerberos ticket-granting service tickets, or Guest accounts without Guest access enabled\r\n
0xb00103eb | The server received an unencrypted message from client when encryption was required. Message was rejected.%n%nClient Name: %4%nClient Address: %8%nUser Name: %6%nSession ID: %9%nShare Name: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that a client is sending unencrypted data even though the SMB share requires encryption.\r\n
0xb00103ec | The server rejected an incorrectly signed message.%n%nClient Name: %2%nClient Address: %6%nUser Name: %4%nSession ID: %7%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that a client is sending an incorrectly signed request.\r\n
0xb00103ed | The server rejected an invalid negotiation request. Connection was terminated.%n%nClient Name: %2%nClient Address: %6%nUser Name: %4%nSession ID: %13%nExpected Dialect: %7%nExpected Capabilities: %8%nExpected Security Mode: %9%nReceived Dialect: %10%nReceived Capabilities: %11%nReceived Security Mode: %12%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that a client is attempting to negotiate a second connection using a mismatched dialect or capabilities.\r\n

0xb00003e8 | S4U2Self authentication failure - The client could not be reauthenticated with S4U2Self to obtain claims.  This may be expected if the account is not a domain account.\r\n
0xb00003e9 | SRV Disabled - The SMB1 negotiate request fails due to SMB1 is disabled.\r\n
0xb00003ea | RKF failure - SRV2 failed to get acknowledgement from Resume Key filter for persistent handle request.\r\n
0xb00003eb | The server received an unencrypted message from client %4. Message was rejected.%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that a client is sending unencrypted data even though the SMB share requires encryption.\r\n
0xb00003ec | The server received an incorrectly signed message from client %2. Message was rejected.%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that a client is sending an incorrectly signed request.\r\n
0xb00003ed | The server failed to validate negotiation from client %2. Connection was terminated.\r\n
0xb00003ee | The share denied access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %10%nClient Address: %6%nUser Name: %8%nSession ID: %17%nShare Name: %2%nShare Path: %4%nStatus: %16 (%15)%nMapped Access: %11%nGranted Access: %12%nSecurity Descriptor: %14%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect access denied errors when a principal accesses a share without the necessary permissions. Usually, this indicates that the principal does not have direct security permissions or lacks membership in a group that has direct access permissions. To determine and correct the permissions on the specified share, an administrator can use the Security tab in File Explorer Properties dialog, the SMBSHARE Windows PowerShell module, or the NET SHARE command. You can also use the Effective Access tab in File Explorer to help diagnose the issue.%n%nApplications may generate access denied errors if they attempt to open files in a writable mode first, and then reopen the files in a read-only mode. In this case, no user action is required.%n%nIf access to the share is denied and this event is not logged, you can examine the file and folder NTFS/REFS permissions.%n%nThis error does not indicate a problem with authentication, only authorization.\r\n
0xb00003ef | The share denied anonymous access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %8%nClient Address: %6%nShare Name: %2%nShare Path: %4%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when a client attempts to connect to shares and does not provide any credentials. This indicates that the client is not providing a user name (and domain credentials, if necessary). By default, anonymous access to shares is denied.%n%nThis error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.\r\n
0xb00003f1 | The server denied anonymous access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %4%n Client Address: %2%nSession ID: %5%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when a client attempts to connect to shares and does not provide any credentials. This indicates that the client is not providing a user name (and domain credentials, if necessary). By default, Windows Server denies anonymous access to shares.%n%nThis error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.\r\n
0xb00003f2 | Endpoint added.%n%nName: %2%nDomain Name: %4%nTransport Name: %6%nTransport Flags: %7%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when the server starts listening on an interface, such as during system restart or when enabling a network adaptor. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f3 | Endpoint removed.%n%nName: %2%nDomain Name: %4%nTransport Name: %6%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when the server stops listening on an interface, such as during shutdown or when disabling a network adaptor. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f4 | The network name information changed.%n%nChange Type: %1%nNet Name: %3%nIP Address: %9%nFlags: %4%nInterface Index: %5%nCapability: %6%nLink Speed: %7%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event on a Windows Failover Cluster node during failover operations, at system startup, or during network configuration. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f5 | Endpoint coming online.%n%nEndpoint Name: %2%nTransport Name: %4%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event on a Windows Failover Cluster node during failover operations. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f6 | Endpoint going offline.%n%nEndpoint Name: %2%nTransport Name: %4%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event on a Windows Failover Cluster node during failover operations. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f7 | Decrypt call failed.%n%nClient Name: %2%nClient Address: %4%nSession ID: %7%nStatus: %6 (%5)%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event commonly occurs because a previous SMB session no longer exists. It may also be caused by packets that are altered on the network between the computers due to either errors or a "man-in-the-middle" attack.\r\n
0xb00003f8 | Reopen failed.%n%nClient Name: %7%nClient Address: %9%nUser Name: %13%nSession ID: %14%nShare Name: %11%nFile Name: %16%nResume Key: %20%nStatus: %2 (%1)%nRKF Status: %4 (%3)%nDurable: %17%nResilient: %18%nPersistent: %19%nReason: %21%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe client attempted to reopen a continuously available handle, but the attempt failed. This typically indicates a problem with the network or underlying file being re-opened.\r\n
0xb00003f9 | Handle scavenged.%n%nShare Name: %7%nFile Name: %9%nResume Key: %5%nPersistent File ID: %3%nVolatile File ID: %4%nDurable: %1%nResilient or Persistent: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server closed a handle that was previously reserved for a client after 60 seconds. You should expect this event on a computer that is continuously available where a client did not gracefully close its session. For instance, this may occur when the client unexpectedly restarted.\r\n
0xb00003fa | Backchannel invalidation of session completed.%n%nSession ID: %1%nStatus: %3 (%2)%nTask Status: %5 (%4)%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event on a computer that is continuously available. No user action is required\r\n
0xb00003fb | Backchannel invalidation of file completed.%n%nResume Key: %1%nStatus: %3 (%2)%nTask Status: %5 (%4)%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event on a computer that is continuously available. No user action is required\r\n
0xb00003fc | File system operation has taken longer than expected.%n%nClient Name: %8%nClient Address: %10%nUser Name: %6%nSession ID: %3%nShare Name: %12%nFile Name: %14%nCommand: %1%nDuration (in milliseconds): %15%nWarning Threshold (in milliseconds): %16%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe underlying file system has taken too long to respond to an operation. This typically indicates a problem with the storage and not SMB.\r\n
0xb00003fd | LmCompatibilityLevel value is different from the default.%n%nConfigured LM Compatibility Level: %1%nDefault LM Compatibility Level: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nLAN Manager (LM) authentication is the protocol used to authenticate Windows clients for network operations. This includes joining a domain, accessing network resources, and authenticating users or computers. This determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is negotiated between the client and the server computers. Specifically, the LM authentication level determines which authentication protocols the client will try to negotiate or the server will accept. The value set for LmCompatibilityLevel determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This value affects the level of authentication protocol that clients use, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.%n%nValue (Setting) - Description%n%n0 (Send LM & NTLM responses) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n1 (Send LM & NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n2 (Send NTLM response only) - Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n3 (Send NTLM v2 response only) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n4 (Send NTLMv2 response only/refuse LM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n5 (Send NTLM v2 response only/refuse LM & NTLM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM and accept only NTLMv2 authentication.%n%nIncompatibly configured  LmCompatibility levels between a client and server (such as 0 on a client and 5 on a server) prevent access to the server. Non-Microsoft clients and servers also provide these configuration settings.\r\n
0xb00003fe | File and printer sharing firewall rule enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that has custom shares configured.\r\n
0xb00003ff | One or more shares present on this server have access based enumeration enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when enabling access-based enumeration on one or more shares by using either Server Manager or the Set-SmbShare Windows PowerShell cmdlet. Access-based enumeration can raise CPU utilization when clients connect to shares with folders containing many peer-level resources to which a user does not have access. You can control the CPU utilization by configuring the ABELevel value in the Windows registry:%n%nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\ABELevel [DWORD]%n%nYou can set the value for ABELevel to greater depths to minimize CPU overhead, but doing so diminishes the effectiveness of access-based enumeration:%n%nValue = 0: access-based enumeration is enabled for all levels%n%nValue = 1: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 1 (example: \server\share)%n%nValue = 2: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 2 (example: \server\share\folder)%n%nYou can continue setting values for multiple depth levels.\r\n
0xb0000400 | SMB2 and SMB3 have been disabled on this server.  This results in reduced functionality and performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: Smb2%nDefault Value: 1 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: 0%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB2/SMB3. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB2/SMB3. When SMB3 is disabled, you cannot use features such as SMB Transparent Failover, SMB Scale Out, SMB Multichannel, SMB Direct (RDMA), SMB Encryption, VSS for SMB file shares, and SMB Directory Leasing. In most scenarios, SMB provides a troubleshooting workaround as an alternative to disabling SMB2/SMB3. Use the Set-SmbServerConfiguration Windows PowerShell cmdlet to enable SMB2/SMB3.\r\n
0xb0000401 | One or more named pipes or shares have been marked for access by anonymous users.  This increases the security risk of the computer by allowing unauthenticated users to connect to this server.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Values: NullSessionPipes, NullSessionShares%nDefault Value: Empty (or not present)%nCurrent Value: Non-empty%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when modifying the default values of NullSessionShares and NullSessionPipes. On a typical file server, these settings do not exist or do not contain values, which is the most secure configuration. By default, domain controllers populate the NullSessionShares entry with netlogon, samr, and lsarpc to allow legacy access methods.\r\n
0xb0000402 | File leasing has been disabled for the SMB2 and SMB3 protocols.  This reduces functionality and can decrease performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: DisableLeasing%nDefault Value: 0 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: non-zero%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB 3 Leasing. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB Leasing. Once disabled, traffic from client to server may increase since metadata and data may no longer be retrieved from a local cache.\r\n
0xb0000403 | The file and printer sharing firewall ports are currently closed.  This is the default configuration for a system that is not sharing content or is on a Public network.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is not configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that does not have custom shares configured. Clients cannot access SMB shares on this computer until SMB traffic is allowed through the firewall.\r\n
0xb0000406 | An MDL read or write completion request failed.%n%nServer Name: %2%nShare Name: %4%nFile Name: %6%nIsRead: %7%nStatus: %8%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe SMB server sends MDL completion requests to a file system upon completion of a buffered I/O to release system resources. The file system and its filter drivers must not fail MDL completion requests. Failures may result in memory leaks and degraded system performance and stability. Non-Microsoft file system filter drivers are the most common cause of failed MDL completion requests.\r\n
0xb0000407 | The server detected a problem and has captured a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%nDump Location: %SystemRoot%\LiveKernelReports%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n
0xb0000408 | The server detected a problem but was unable to capture a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected. In this case, the server's request to create a live kernel dump was rejected. This is usually due to the live kernel dump throttle, which prevents frequent dumps from consuming too much disk space. Either wait for the throttle limit to expire (by default, 7 days), or contact Microsoft Support for steps to override the throttle. This event is written to the log no more than once per day. The problem that caused the server to the request a live kernel dump may be occuring more frequently.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n
0xb0000708 | CA failure - Failed to set continuously available property on a new or existing file share as the file share is not a cluster share.\r\n
0xb0000709 | CA failure - Failed to set continuously available property on a new or existing file share as Resume Key filter is not started or has failed to attach to the underlying volume.\r\n
0xb000070a | The server failed to reserve the next ID region in the cluster registry.\r\n
0xb00007d0 | Packet Fragment (%2 bytes)\r\n
0xb0000bb8 | SMB1 access%n%nClient Address: %1%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that a client attempted to access the server using SMB1. To stop auditing SMB1 access, use the Windows PowerShell cmdlet Set-SmbServerConfiguration.\r\n
0xb0009c40 | Packet (%4 bytes)\r\n
0xb0010227 | SMB Session Authentication Failure%n%nClient Name: %11%nClient Address: %6%nUser Name: %9%nSession ID: %7%nStatus: %4 (%3)%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when attempting to connect to shares using incorrect credentials.%n%nThis error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.%n%nThis error can occur when using incorrect usernames and passwords with NTLM, mismatched LmCompatibility settings between client and server, duplicate Kerberos service principal names, incorrect Kerberos ticket-granting service tickets, or Guest accounts without Guest access enabled\r\n
0xb00103e9 | A client attempted to access the server using SMB1 and was rejected because SMB1 file sharing support is disabled or has been uninstalled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nAn administrator has disabled or uninstalled server support for SMB1. Clients running Windows XP / Windows Server 2003 R2 and earlier will not be able to access this server. Clients running Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 and later no longer require SMB1. To determine which clients are attempting to access this server using SMB1, use the Windows PowerShell cmdlet Set-SmbServerConfiguration to enable SMB1 access auditing.\r\n
0xb00103eb | The server received an unencrypted message from client when encryption was required. Message was rejected.%n%nClient Name: %4%nClient Address: %8%nUser Name: %6%nSession ID: %9%nShare Name: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that a client is sending unencrypted data even though the SMB share requires encryption.\r\n
0xb00103ec | The server rejected an incorrectly signed message.%n%nClient Name: %2%nClient Address: %6%nUser Name: %4%nSession ID: %7%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that a client is sending an incorrectly signed request.\r\n
0xb00103ed | The server rejected an invalid negotiation request.

Usually, this indicates that the principal does not have direct security permissions or lacks membership in a group that has direct access permissions. To determine and correct the permissions on the specified share, an administrator can use the Security tab in File Explorer Properties dialog, the SMBSHARE Windows PowerShell module, or the NET SHARE command. You can also use the Effective Access tab in File Explorer to help diagnose the issue.%n%nApplications may generate access denied errors if they attempt to open files in a writable mode first, and then reopen the files in a read-only mode. In this case, no user action is required.%n%nIf access to the share is denied and this event is not logged, you can examine the file and folder NTFS/REFS permissions.%n%nThis error does not indicate a problem with authentication, only authorization.\r\n

This typically indicates a problem with the storage and not SMB.\r\n
0xb00003fd | LmCompatibilityLevel value is different from the default.%n%nConfigured LM Compatibility Level: %1%nDefault LM Compatibility Level: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nLAN Manager (LM) authentication is the protocol used to authenticate Windows clients for network operations. This includes joining a domain, accessing network resources, and authenticating users or computers. This determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is negotiated between the client and the server computers. Specifically, the LM authentication level determines which authentication protocols the client will try to negotiate or the server will accept. The value set for LmCompatibilityLevel determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This value affects the level of authentication protocol that clients use, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.%n%nValue (Setting) - Description%n%n0 (Send LM & NTLM responses) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n1 (Send LM & NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n2 (Send NTLM response only) - Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n3 (Send NTLM v2 response only) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n4 (Send NTLMv2 response only/refuse LM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n5 (Send NTLM v2 response only/refuse LM & NTLM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM and accept only NTLMv2 authentication.%n%nIncompatibly configured  LmCompatibility levels between a client and server (such as 0 on a client and 5 on a server) prevent access to the server. Non-Microsoft clients and servers also provide these configuration settings.\r\n
0xb00003fe | File and printer sharing firewall rule enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that has custom shares configured.\r\n
0xb00003ff | One or more shares present on this server have access based enumeration enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when enabling access-based enumeration on one or more shares by using either Server Manager or the Set-SmbShare Windows PowerShell cmdlet. Access-based enumeration can raise CPU utilization when clients connect to shares with folders containing many peer-level resources to which a user does not have access. You can control the CPU utilization by configuring the ABELevel value in the Windows registry:%n%nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\ABELevel [DWORD]%n%nYou can set the value for ABELevel to greater depths to minimize CPU overhead, but doing so diminishes the effectiveness of access-based enumeration:%n%nValue = 0: access-based enumeration is enabled for all levels%n%nValue = 1: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 1 (example: \server\share)%n%nValue = 2: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 2 (example: \server\share\folder)%n%nYou can continue setting values for multiple depth levels.\r\n
0xb0000400 | SMB2 and SMB3 have been disabled on this server.  This results in reduced functionality and performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: Smb2%nDefault Value: 1 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: 0%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB2/SMB3. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB2/SMB3. When SMB3 is disabled, you cannot use features such as SMB Transparent Failover, SMB Scale Out, SMB Multichannel, SMB Direct (RDMA), SMB Encryption, VSS for SMB file shares, and SMB Directory Leasing. In most scenarios, SMB provides a troubleshooting workaround as an alternative to disabling SMB2/SMB3. Use the Set-SmbServerConfiguration Windows PowerShell cmdlet to enable SMB2/SMB3.\r\n
0xb0000401 | One or more named pipes or shares have been marked for access by anonymous users.  This increases the security risk of the computer by allowing unauthenticated users to connect to this server.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Values: NullSessionPipes, NullSessionShares%nDefault Value: Empty (or not present)%nCurrent Value: Non-empty%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when modifying the default values of NullSessionShares and NullSessionPipes. On a typical file server, these settings do not exist or do not contain values, which is the most secure configuration. By default, domain controllers populate the NullSessionShares entry with netlogon, samr, and lsarpc to allow legacy access methods.\r\n
0xb0000402 | File leasing has been disabled for the SMB2 and SMB3 protocols.  This reduces functionality and can decrease performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: DisableLeasing%nDefault Value: 0 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: non-zero%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB 3 Leasing. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB Leasing. Once disabled, traffic from client to server may increase since metadata and data may no longer be retrieved from a local cache.\r\n
0xb0000403 | The file and printer sharing firewall ports are currently closed.  This is the default configuration for a system that is not sharing content or is on a Public network.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is not configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that does not have custom shares configured. Clients cannot access SMB shares on this computer until SMB traffic is allowed through the firewall.\r\n
0xb0000404 | The maximum cluster-supported SMB dialect has changed.%n%nNewMaxDialect: %1%nOldMaxDialect: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event during a Windows Failover Cluster upgrade. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb0000405 | The Cipher Suite Order group policy setting is invalid.%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that an administrator has configured an invalid value for the "Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Network\Lanman Server\Cipher Suite Order" group policy setting. The server will use the default cipher suite order "%1" until this error is resolved.\r\n
0xb0000406 | An MDL read or write completion request failed.%n%nServer Name: %2%nShare Name: %4%nFile Name: %6%nIsRead: %7%nStatus: %8%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe SMB server sends MDL completion requests to a file system upon completion of a buffered I/O to release system resources. The file system and its filter drivers must not fail MDL completion requests. Failures may result in memory leaks and degraded system performance and stability. Non-Microsoft file system filter drivers are the most common cause of failed MDL completion requests.\r\n
0xb0000407 | The server detected a problem and has captured a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%nDump Location: %SystemRoot%\LiveKernelReports%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n
0xb0000408 | The server detected a problem but was unable to capture a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected. In this case, the server's request to create a live kernel dump was rejected. This is usually due to the live kernel dump throttle, which prevents frequent dumps from consuming too much disk space. Either wait for the throttle limit to expire (by default, 7 days), or contact Microsoft Support for steps to override the throttle. This event is written to the log no more than once per day. The problem that caused the server to the request a live kernel dump may be occuring more frequently.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n

It is more common with non-Windows clients.%n%nThis error can occur when using incorrect usernames and passwords with NTLM, mismatched LmCompatibility settings between client and server, duplicate Kerberos service principal names, incorrect Kerberos ticket-granting service tickets, or Guest accounts without Guest access enabled\r\n
0xb00103e9 | A client attempted to access the server using SMB1 and was rejected because SMB1 file sharing support is disabled or has been uninstalled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nAn administrator has disabled or uninstalled server support for SMB1. Clients running Windows XP / Windows Server 2003 R2 and earlier will not be able to access this server. Clients running Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 and later no longer require SMB1. To determine which clients are attempting to access this server using SMB1, use the Windows PowerShell cmdlet Set-SmbServerConfiguration to enable SMB1 access auditing.\r\n

0xb00003eb | The server received an unencrypted message from client %4. Message was rejected.%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that a client is sending unencrypted data even though the SMB share requires encryption.\r\n
0xb00003ec | The server received an incorrectly signed message from client %2. Message was rejected.%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that a client is sending an incorrectly signed request.\r\n
0xb00003ed | The server failed to validate negotiation from client %2. Connection was terminated.\r\n
0xb00003ee | The share denied access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %10%nClient Address: %6%nUser Name: %8%nSession ID: %17%nShare Name: %2%nShare Path: %4%nStatus: %16 (%15)%nMapped Access: %11%nGranted Access: %12%nSecurity Descriptor: %14%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect access denied errors when a principal accesses a share without the necessary permissions. Usually, this indicates that the principal does not have direct security permissions or lacks membership in a group that has direct access permissions. To determine and correct the permissions on the specified share, an administrator can use the Security tab in File Explorer Properties dialog, the SMBSHARE Windows PowerShell module, or the NET SHARE command. You can also use the Effective Access tab in File Explorer to help diagnose the issue.%n%nApplications may generate access denied errors if they attempt to open files in a writable mode first, and then reopen the files in a read-only mode. In this case, no user action is required.%n%nIf access to the share is denied and this event is not logged, you can examine the file and folder NTFS/REFS permissions.%n%nThis error does not indicate a problem with authentication, only authorization.\r\n
0xb00003ef | The share denied anonymous access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %8%nClient Address: %6%nShare Name: %2%nShare Path: %4%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when a client attempts to connect to shares and does not provide any credentials. This indicates that the client is not providing a user name (and domain credentials, if necessary). By default, anonymous access to shares is denied.%n%nThis error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.\r\n
0xb00003f1 | The server denied anonymous access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %4%n Client Address: %2%nSession ID: %5%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when a client attempts to connect to shares and does not provide any credentials. This indicates that the client is not providing a user name (and domain credentials, if necessary). By default, Windows Server denies anonymous access to shares.%n%nThis error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.\r\n
0xb00003f2 | Endpoint added.%n%nName: %2%nDomain Name: %4%nTransport Name: %6%nTransport Flags: %7%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when the server starts listening on an interface, such as during system restart or when enabling a network adaptor. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f3 | Endpoint removed.%n%nName: %2%nDomain Name: %4%nTransport Name: %6%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when the server stops listening on an interface, such as during shutdown or when disabling a network adaptor. No user action is required.\r\n

0xb00003f7 | Decrypt call failed.%n%nClient Name: %2%nClient Address: %4%nSession ID: %7%nStatus: %6 (%5)%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event commonly occurs because a previous SMB session no longer exists. It may also be caused by packets that are altered on the network between the computers due to either errors or a "man-in-the-middle" attack.\r\n
0xb00003f8 | Reopen failed.%n%nClient Name: %7%nClient Address: %9%nUser Name: %13%nSession ID: %14%nShare Name: %11%nFile Name: %16%nResume Key: %20%nStatus: %2 (%1)%nRKF Status: %4 (%3)%nDurable: %17%nResilient: %18%nPersistent: %19%nReason: %21%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe client attempted to reopen a continuously available handle, but the attempt failed.

This typically indicates a problem with the storage and not SMB.\r\n
0xb00003fd | LmCompatibilityLevel value is different from the default.%n%nConfigured LM Compatibility Level: %1%nDefault LM Compatibility Level: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nLAN Manager (LM) authentication is the protocol used to authenticate Windows clients for network operations. This includes joining a domain, accessing network resources, and authenticating users or computers. This determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is negotiated between the client and the server computers. Specifically, the LM authentication level determines which authentication protocols the client will try to negotiate or the server will accept. The value set for LmCompatibilityLevel determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This value affects the level of authentication protocol that clients use, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.%n%nValue (Setting) - Description%n%n0 (Send LM & NTLM responses) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n1 (Send LM & NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n2 (Send NTLM response only) - Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n3 (Send NTLM v2 response only) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n4 (Send NTLMv2 response only/refuse LM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n5 (Send NTLM v2 response only/refuse LM & NTLM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM and accept only NTLMv2 authentication.%n%nIncompatibly configured  LmCompatibility levels between a client and server (such as 0 on a client and 5 on a server) prevent access to the server. Non-Microsoft clients and servers also provide these configuration settings.\r\n
0xb00003fe | File and printer sharing firewall rule enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that has custom shares configured.\r\n
0xb00003ff | One or more shares present on this server have access based enumeration enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when enabling access-based enumeration on one or more shares by using either Server Manager or the Set-SmbShare Windows PowerShell cmdlet. Access-based enumeration can raise CPU utilization when clients connect to shares with folders containing many peer-level resources to which a user does not have access. You can control the CPU utilization by configuring the ABELevel value in the Windows registry:%n%nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\ABELevel [DWORD]%n%nYou can set the value for ABELevel to greater depths to minimize CPU overhead, but doing so diminishes the effectiveness of access-based enumeration:%n%nValue = 0: access-based enumeration is enabled for all levels%n%nValue = 1: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 1 (example: \server\share)%n%nValue = 2: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 2 (example: \server\share\folder)%n%nYou can continue setting values for multiple depth levels.\r\n
0xb0000400 | SMB2 and SMB3 have been disabled on this server.  This results in reduced functionality and performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: Smb2%nDefault Value: 1 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: 0%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB2/SMB3. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB2/SMB3. When SMB3 is disabled, you cannot use features such as SMB Transparent Failover, SMB Scale Out, SMB Multichannel, SMB Direct (RDMA), SMB Encryption, VSS for SMB file shares, and SMB Directory Leasing. In most scenarios, SMB provides a troubleshooting workaround as an alternative to disabling SMB2/SMB3. Use the Set-SmbServerConfiguration Windows PowerShell cmdlet to enable SMB2/SMB3.\r\n
0xb0000401 | One or more named pipes or shares have been marked for access by anonymous users.  This increases the security risk of the computer by allowing unauthenticated users to connect to this server.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Values: NullSessionPipes, NullSessionShares%nDefault Value: Empty (or not present)%nCurrent Value: Non-empty%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when modifying the default values of NullSessionShares and NullSessionPipes. On a typical file server, these settings do not exist or do not contain values, which is the most secure configuration. By default, domain controllers populate the NullSessionShares entry with netlogon, samr, and lsarpc to allow legacy access methods.\r\n
0xb0000402 | File leasing has been disabled for the SMB2 and SMB3 protocols.  This reduces functionality and can decrease performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: DisableLeasing%nDefault Value: 0 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: non-zero%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB 3 Leasing. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB Leasing. Once disabled, traffic from client to server may increase since metadata and data may no longer be retrieved from a local cache.\r\n
0xb0000403 | The file and printer sharing firewall ports are currently closed.  This is the default configuration for a system that is not sharing content or is on a Public network.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is not configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that does not have custom shares configured. Clients cannot access SMB shares on this computer until SMB traffic is allowed through the firewall.\r\n
0xb0000404 | The maximum cluster-supported SMB dialect has changed.%n%nNewMaxDialect: %1%nOldMaxDialect: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event during a Windows Failover Cluster upgrade. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb0000405 | The Cipher Suite Order group policy setting is invalid.%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that an administrator has configured an invalid value for the "Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Network\Lanman Server\Cipher Suite Order" group policy setting. The server will use the default cipher suite order "%1" until this error is resolved.\r\n
0xb0000406 | An MDL read or write completion request failed.%n%nServer Name: %2%nShare Name: %4%nFile Name: %6%nIsRead: %7%nStatus: %8%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe SMB server sends MDL completion requests to a file system upon completion of a buffered I/O to release system resources. The file system and its filter drivers must not fail MDL completion requests. Failures may result in memory leaks and degraded system performance and stability. Non-Microsoft file system filter drivers are the most common cause of failed MDL completion requests.\r\n
0xb0000407 | The server detected a problem and has captured a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%nDump Location: %SystemRoot%\LiveKernelReports%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n
0xb0000408 | The server detected a problem but was unable to capture a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected. In this case, the server's request to create a live kernel dump was rejected. This is usually due to the live kernel dump throttle, which prevents frequent dumps from consuming too much disk space. Either wait for the throttle limit to expire (by default, 7 days), or contact Microsoft Support for steps to override the throttle. This event is written to the log no more than once per day. The problem that caused the server to the request a live kernel dump may be occuring more frequently.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n

0xb00103e9 | A client attempted to access the server using SMB1 and was rejected because SMB1 file sharing support is disabled or has been uninstalled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nAn administrator has disabled or uninstalled server support for SMB1. Clients running Windows XP / Windows Server 2003 R2 and earlier will not be able to access this server. Clients running Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 and later no longer require SMB1. To determine which clients are attempting to access this server using SMB1, use the Windows PowerShell cmdlet Set-SmbServerConfiguration to enable SMB1 access auditing.\r\n

Usually, this indicates that the principal does not have direct security permissions or lacks membership in a group that has direct access permissions. To determine and correct the permissions on the specified share, an administrator can use the Security tab in File Explorer Properties dialog, the SMBSHARE Windows PowerShell module, or the NET SHARE command. You can also use the Effective Access tab in File Explorer to help diagnose the issue.%n%nApplications may generate access denied errors if they attempt to open files in a writable mode first, and then reopen the files in a read-only mode. In this case, no user action is required.%n%nIf access to the share is denied and this event is not logged, you can examine the file and folder NTFS/REFS permissions.%n%nThis error does not indicate a problem with authentication, only authorization.\r\n
0xb00003ef | The share denied anonymous access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %8%nClient Address: %6%nShare Name: %2%nShare Path: %4%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when a client attempts to connect to shares and does not provide any credentials. This indicates that the client is not providing a user name (and domain credentials, if necessary). By default, anonymous access to shares is denied.%n%nThis error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.\r\n
0xb00003f1 | The server denied anonymous access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %4%n Client Address: %2%nSession ID: %5%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when a client attempts to connect to shares and does not provide any credentials. This indicates that the client is not providing a user name (and domain credentials, if necessary). By default, Windows Server denies anonymous access to shares.%n%nThis error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.\r\n
0xb00003f2 | Endpoint added.%n%nName: %2%nDomain Name: %4%nTransport Name: %6%nTransport Flags: %7%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when the server starts listening on an interface, such as during system restart or when enabling a network adaptor. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f3 | Endpoint removed.%n%nName: %2%nDomain Name: %4%nTransport Name: %6%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when the server stops listening on an interface, such as during shutdown or when disabling a network adaptor. No user action is required.\r\n

0xb00003f7 | Decrypt call failed.%n%nClient Name: %2%nClient Address: %4%nSession ID: %7%nStatus: %6 (%5)%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event commonly occurs because a previous SMB session no longer exists. It may also be caused by packets that are altered on the network between the computers due to either errors or a "man-in-the-middle" attack.\r\n
0xb00003f8 | Reopen failed.%n%nClient Name: %7%nClient Address: %9%nUser Name: %13%nSession ID: %14%nShare Name: %11%nFile Name: %16%nResume Key: %20%nStatus: %2 (%1)%nRKF Status: %4 (%3)%nDurable: %17%nResilient: %18%nPersistent: %19%nReason: %21%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe client attempted to reopen a continuously available handle, but the attempt failed.

This typically indicates a problem with the storage and not SMB.\r\n
0xb00003fd | LmCompatibilityLevel value is different from the default.%n%nConfigured LM Compatibility Level: %1%nDefault LM Compatibility Level: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nLAN Manager (LM) authentication is the protocol used to authenticate Windows clients for network operations. This includes joining a domain, accessing network resources, and authenticating users or computers. This determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is negotiated between the client and the server computers. Specifically, the LM authentication level determines which authentication protocols the client will try to negotiate or the server will accept. The value set for LmCompatibilityLevel determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This value affects the level of authentication protocol that clients use, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.%n%nValue (Setting) - Description%n%n0 (Send LM & NTLM responses) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n1 (Send LM & NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n2 (Send NTLM response only) - Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n3 (Send NTLM v2 response only) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n4 (Send NTLMv2 response only/refuse LM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n5 (Send NTLM v2 response only/refuse LM & NTLM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM and accept only NTLMv2 authentication.%n%nIncompatibly configured  LmCompatibility levels between a client and server (such as 0 on a client and 5 on a server) prevent access to the server. Non-Microsoft clients and servers also provide these configuration settings.\r\n
0xb00003fe | File and printer sharing firewall rule enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that has custom shares configured.\r\n
0xb00003ff | One or more shares present on this server have access based enumeration enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when enabling access-based enumeration on one or more shares by using either Server Manager or the Set-SmbShare Windows PowerShell cmdlet. Access-based enumeration can raise CPU utilization when clients connect to shares with folders containing many peer-level resources to which a user does not have access. You can control the CPU utilization by configuring the ABELevel value in the Windows registry:%n%nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\ABELevel [DWORD]%n%nYou can set the value for ABELevel to greater depths to minimize CPU overhead, but doing so diminishes the effectiveness of access-based enumeration:%n%nValue = 0: access-based enumeration is enabled for all levels%n%nValue = 1: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 1 (example: \server\share)%n%nValue = 2: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 2 (example: \server\share\folder)%n%nYou can continue setting values for multiple depth levels.\r\n
0xb0000400 | SMB2 and SMB3 have been disabled on this server.  This results in reduced functionality and performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: Smb2%nDefault Value: 1 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: 0%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB2/SMB3. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB2/SMB3. When SMB3 is disabled, you cannot use features such as SMB Transparent Failover, SMB Scale Out, SMB Multichannel, SMB Direct (RDMA), SMB Encryption, VSS for SMB file shares, and SMB Directory Leasing. In most scenarios, SMB provides a troubleshooting workaround as an alternative to disabling SMB2/SMB3. Use the Set-SmbServerConfiguration Windows PowerShell cmdlet to enable SMB2/SMB3.\r\n
0xb0000401 | One or more named pipes or shares have been marked for access by anonymous users.  This increases the security risk of the computer by allowing unauthenticated users to connect to this server.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Values: NullSessionPipes, NullSessionShares%nDefault Value: Empty (or not present)%nCurrent Value: Non-empty%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when modifying the default values of NullSessionShares and NullSessionPipes. On a typical file server, these settings do not exist or do not contain values, which is the most secure configuration. By default, domain controllers populate the NullSessionShares entry with netlogon, samr, and lsarpc to allow legacy access methods.\r\n
0xb0000402 | File leasing has been disabled for the SMB2 and SMB3 protocols.  This reduces functionality and can decrease performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: DisableLeasing%nDefault Value: 0 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: non-zero%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB 3 Leasing. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB Leasing. Once disabled, traffic from client to server may increase since metadata and data may no longer be retrieved from a local cache.\r\n
0xb0000403 | The file and printer sharing firewall ports are currently closed.  This is the default configuration for a system that is not sharing content or is on a Public network.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is not configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that does not have custom shares configured. Clients cannot access SMB shares on this computer until SMB traffic is allowed through the firewall.\r\n
0xb0000404 | The maximum cluster-supported SMB dialect has changed.%n%nNewMaxDialect: %1%nOldMaxDialect: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event during a Windows Failover Cluster upgrade. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb0000405 | The Cipher Suite Order group policy setting is invalid.%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that an administrator has configured an invalid value for the "Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Network\Lanman Server\Cipher Suite Order" group policy setting. The server will use the default cipher suite order "%1" until this error is resolved.\r\n
0xb0000406 | An MDL read or write completion request failed.%n%nServer Name: %2%nShare Name: %4%nFile Name: %6%nIsRead: %7%nStatus: %8%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe SMB server sends MDL completion requests to a file system upon completion of a buffered I/O to release system resources. The file system and its filter drivers must not fail MDL completion requests. Failures may result in memory leaks and degraded system performance and stability. Non-Microsoft file system filter drivers are the most common cause of failed MDL completion requests.\r\n
0xb0000407 | The server detected a problem and has captured a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%nDump Location: %SystemRoot%\LiveKernelReports%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n
0xb0000408 | The server detected a problem but was unable to capture a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected. In this case, the server's request to create a live kernel dump was rejected. This is usually due to the live kernel dump throttle, which prevents frequent dumps from consuming too much disk space. Either wait for the throttle limit to expire (by default, 7 days), or contact Microsoft Support for steps to override the throttle. This event is written to the log no more than once per day. The problem that caused the server to the request a live kernel dump may be occuring more frequently.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n

It is more common with non-Windows clients.%n%nThis error can occur when using incorrect usernames and passwords with NTLM, mismatched LmCompatibility settings between client and server, duplicate Kerberos service principal names, incorrect Kerberos ticket-granting service tickets, or Guest accounts without Guest access enabled\r\n
0xb00103e9 | A client attempted to access the server using SMB1 and was rejected because SMB1 file sharing support is disabled or has been uninstalled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nAn administrator has disabled or uninstalled server support for SMB1. Clients running Windows XP / Windows Server 2003 R2 and earlier will not be able to access this server. Clients running Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 and later no longer require SMB1. To determine which clients are attempting to access this server using SMB1, use the Windows PowerShell cmdlet Set-SmbServerConfiguration to enable SMB1 access auditing.\r\n

0xb00003ec | The server received an incorrectly signed message from client %2. Message was rejected.%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that a client is sending an incorrectly signed request.\r\n
0xb00003ed | The server failed to validate negotiation from client %2. Connection was terminated.\r\n
0xb00003ee | The share denied access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %10%nClient Address: %6%nUser Name: %8%nSession ID: %17%nShare Name: %2%nShare Path: %4%nStatus: %16 (%15)%nMapped Access: %11%nGranted Access: %12%nSecurity Descriptor: %14%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect access denied errors when a principal accesses a share without the necessary permissions. Usually, this indicates that the principal does not have direct security permissions or lacks membership in a group that has direct access permissions. To determine and correct the permissions on the specified share, an administrator can use the Security tab in File Explorer Properties dialog, the SMBSHARE Windows PowerShell module, or the NET SHARE command. You can also use the Effective Access tab in File Explorer to help diagnose the issue.%n%nApplications may generate access denied errors if they attempt to open files in a writable mode first, and then reopen the files in a read-only mode. In this case, no user action is required.%n%nIf access to the share is denied and this event is not logged, you can examine the file and folder NTFS/REFS permissions.%n%nThis error does not indicate a problem with authentication, only authorization.\r\n
0xb00003ef | The share denied anonymous access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %8%nClient Address: %6%nShare Name: %2%nShare Path: %4%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when a client attempts to connect to shares and does not provide any credentials. This indicates that the client is not providing a user name (and domain credentials, if necessary). By default, anonymous access to shares is denied.%n%nThis error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.\r\n
0xb00003f1 | The server denied anonymous access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %4%n Client Address: %2%nSession ID: %5%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when a client attempts to connect to shares and does not provide any credentials. This indicates that the client is not providing a user name (and domain credentials, if necessary). By default, Windows Server denies anonymous access to shares.%n%nThis error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.\r\n
0xb00003f2 | Endpoint added.%n%nName: %2%nDomain Name: %4%nTransport Name: %6%nTransport Flags: %7%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when the server starts listening on an interface, such as during system restart or when enabling a network adaptor. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f3 | Endpoint removed.%n%nName: %2%nDomain Name: %4%nTransport Name: %6%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when the server stops listening on an interface, such as during shutdown or when disabling a network adaptor. No user action is required.\r\n

No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f5 | Endpoint coming online.%n%nEndpoint Name: %2%nTransport Name: %4%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event on a Windows Failover Cluster node during failover operations. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f6 | Endpoint going offline.%n%nEndpoint Name: %2%nTransport Name: %4%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event on a Windows Failover Cluster node during failover operations. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f7 | Decrypt call failed.%n%nClient Name: %2%nClient Address: %4%nSession ID: %7%nStatus: %6 (%5)%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event commonly occurs because a previous SMB session no longer exists. It may also be caused by packets that are altered on the network between the computers due to either errors or a "man-in-the-middle" attack.\r\n
0xb00003f8 | Reopen failed.%n%nClient Name: %7%nClient Address: %9%nUser Name: %13%nSession ID: %14%nShare Name: %11%nFile Name: %16%nResume Key: %20%nStatus: %2 (%1)%nRKF Status: %4 (%3)%nDurable: %17%nResilient: %18%nPersistent: %19%nReason: %21%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe client attempted to reopen a continuously available handle, but the attempt failed. This typically indicates a problem with the network or underlying file being re-opened.\r\n
0xb00003f9 | Handle scavenged.%n%nShare Name: %7%nFile Name: %9%nResume Key: %5%nPersistent File ID: %3%nVolatile File ID: %4%nDurable: %1%nResilient or Persistent: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server closed a handle that was previously reserved for a client after 60 seconds. You should expect this event on a computer that is continuously available where a client did not gracefully close its session. For instance, this may occur when the client unexpectedly restarted.\r\n
0xb00003fa | Backchannel invalidation of session completed.%n%nSession ID: %1%nStatus: %3 (%2)%nTask Status: %5 (%4)%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event on a computer that is continuously available. No user action is required\r\n
0xb00003fb | Backchannel invalidation of file completed.%n%nResume Key: %1%nStatus: %3 (%2)%nTask Status: %5 (%4)%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event on a computer that is continuously available. No user action is required\r\n
0xb00003fc | File system operation has taken longer than expected.%n%nClient Name: %8%nClient Address: %10%nUser Name: %6%nSession ID: %3%nShare Name: %12%nFile Name: %14%nCommand: %1%nDuration (in milliseconds): %15%nWarning Threshold (in milliseconds): %16%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe underlying file system has taken too long to respond to an operation. This typically indicates a problem with the storage and not SMB.\r\n
0xb00003fd | LmCompatibilityLevel value is different from the default.%n%nConfigured LM Compatibility Level: %1%nDefault LM Compatibility Level: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nLAN Manager (LM) authentication is the protocol used to authenticate Windows clients for network operations. This includes joining a domain, accessing network resources, and authenticating users or computers. This determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is negotiated between the client and the server computers. Specifically, the LM authentication level determines which authentication protocols the client will try to negotiate or the server will accept. The value set for LmCompatibilityLevel determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This value affects the level of authentication protocol that clients use, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.%n%nValue (Setting) - Description%n%n0 (Send LM & NTLM responses) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n1 (Send LM & NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n2 (Send NTLM response only) - Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n3 (Send NTLM v2 response only) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n4 (Send NTLMv2 response only/refuse LM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n5 (Send NTLM v2 response only/refuse LM & NTLM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM and accept only NTLMv2 authentication.%n%nIncompatibly configured  LmCompatibility levels between a client and server (such as 0 on a client and 5 on a server) prevent access to the server. Non-Microsoft clients and servers also provide these configuration settings.\r\n
0xb00003fe | File and printer sharing firewall rule enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that has custom shares configured.\r\n
0xb00003ff | One or more shares present on this server have access based enumeration enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when enabling access-based enumeration on one or more shares by using either Server Manager or the Set-SmbShare Windows PowerShell cmdlet. Access-based enumeration can raise CPU utilization when clients connect to shares with folders containing many peer-level resources to which a user does not have access. You can control the CPU utilization by configuring the ABELevel value in the Windows registry:%n%nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\ABELevel [DWORD]%n%nYou can set the value for ABELevel to greater depths to minimize CPU overhead, but doing so diminishes the effectiveness of access-based enumeration:%n%nValue = 0: access-based enumeration is enabled for all levels%n%nValue = 1: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 1 (example: \server\share)%n%nValue = 2: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 2 (example: \server\share\folder)%n%nYou can continue setting values for multiple depth levels.\r\n
0xb0000400 | SMB2 and SMB3 have been disabled on this server.  This results in reduced functionality and performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: Smb2%nDefault Value: 1 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: 0%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB2/SMB3. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB2/SMB3. When SMB3 is disabled, you cannot use features such as SMB Transparent Failover, SMB Scale Out, SMB Multichannel, SMB Direct (RDMA), SMB Encryption, VSS for SMB file shares, and SMB Directory Leasing. In most scenarios, SMB provides a troubleshooting workaround as an alternative to disabling SMB2/SMB3. Use the Set-SmbServerConfiguration Windows PowerShell cmdlet to enable SMB2/SMB3.\r\n
0xb0000401 | One or more named pipes or shares have been marked for access by anonymous users.  This increases the security risk of the computer by allowing unauthenticated users to connect to this server.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Values: NullSessionPipes, NullSessionShares%nDefault Value: Empty (or not present)%nCurrent Value: Non-empty%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when modifying the default values of NullSessionShares and NullSessionPipes. On a typical file server, these settings do not exist or do not contain values, which is the most secure configuration. By default, domain controllers populate the NullSessionShares entry with netlogon, samr, and lsarpc to allow legacy access methods.\r\n
0xb0000402 | File leasing has been disabled for the SMB2 and SMB3 protocols.  This reduces functionality and can decrease performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: DisableLeasing%nDefault Value: 0 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: non-zero%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB 3 Leasing. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB Leasing. Once disabled, traffic from client to server may increase since metadata and data may no longer be retrieved from a local cache.\r\n
0xb0000403 | The file and printer sharing firewall ports are currently closed.  This is the default configuration for a system that is not sharing content or is on a Public network.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is not configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that does not have custom shares configured. Clients cannot access SMB shares on this computer until SMB traffic is allowed through the firewall.\r\n
0xb0000404 | The maximum cluster-supported SMB dialect has changed.%n%nNewMaxDialect: %1%nOldMaxDialect: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event during a Windows Failover Cluster upgrade. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb0000405 | The Cipher Suite Order group policy setting is invalid.%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that an administrator has configured an invalid value for the "Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Network\Lanman Server\Cipher Suite Order" group policy setting. The server will use the default cipher suite order "%1" until this error is resolved.\r\n
0xb0000406 | An MDL read or write completion request failed.%n%nServer Name: %2%nShare Name: %4%nFile Name: %6%nIsRead: %7%nStatus: %8%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe SMB server sends MDL completion requests to a file system upon completion of a buffered I/O to release system resources. The file system and its filter drivers must not fail MDL completion requests. Failures may result in memory leaks and degraded system performance and stability. Non-Microsoft file system filter drivers are the most common cause of failed MDL completion requests.\r\n
0xb0000407 | The server detected a problem and has captured a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%nDump Location: %SystemRoot%\LiveKernelReports%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n
0xb0000408 | The server detected a problem but was unable to capture a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected. In this case, the server's request to create a live kernel dump was rejected. This is usually due to the live kernel dump throttle, which prevents frequent dumps from consuming too much disk space. Either wait for the throttle limit to expire (by default, 7 days), or contact Microsoft Support for steps to override the throttle. This event is written to the log no more than once per day. The problem that caused the server to the request a live kernel dump may be occuring more frequently.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n

It is more common with non-Windows clients.%n%nThis error can occur when using incorrect usernames and passwords with NTLM, mismatched LmCompatibility settings between client and server, duplicate Kerberos service principal names, incorrect Kerberos ticket-granting service tickets, or Guest accounts without Guest access enabled\r\n
0xb00103e9 | A client attempted to access the server using SMB1 and was rejected because SMB1 file sharing support is disabled or has been uninstalled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nAn administrator has disabled or uninstalled server support for SMB1. Clients running Windows XP / Windows Server 2003 R2 and earlier will not be able to access this server. Clients running Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 and later no longer require SMB1. To determine which clients are attempting to access this server using SMB1, use the Windows PowerShell cmdlet Set-SmbServerConfiguration to enable SMB1 access auditing.\r\n

Usually, this indicates that the principal does not have direct security permissions or lacks membership in a group that has direct access permissions. To determine and correct the permissions on the specified share, an administrator can use the Security tab in File Explorer Properties dialog, the SMBSHARE Windows PowerShell module, or the NET SHARE command. You can also use the Effective Access tab in File Explorer to help diagnose the issue.%n%nApplications may generate access denied errors if they attempt to open files in a writable mode first, and then reopen the files in a read-only mode. In this case, no user action is required.%n%nIf access to the share is denied and this event is not logged, you can examine the file and folder NTFS/REFS permissions.%n%nThis error does not indicate a problem with authentication, only authorization.\r\n
0xb00003ef | The share denied anonymous access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %8%nClient Address: %6%nShare Name: %2%nShare Path: %4%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when a client attempts to connect to shares and does not provide any credentials. This indicates that the client is not providing a user name (and domain credentials, if necessary). By default, anonymous access to shares is denied.%n%nThis error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.\r\n
0xb00003f1 | The server denied anonymous access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %4%n Client Address: %2%nSession ID: %5%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when a client attempts to connect to shares and does not provide any credentials.

0xb00003f7 | Decrypt call failed.%n%nClient Name: %2%nClient Address: %4%nSession ID: %7%nStatus: %6 (%5)%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event commonly occurs because a previous SMB session no longer exists. It may also be caused by packets that are altered on the network between the computers due to either errors or a "man-in-the-middle" attack.\r\n
0xb00003f8 | Reopen failed.%n%nClient Name: %7%nClient Address: %9%nUser Name: %13%nSession ID: %14%nShare Name: %11%nFile Name: %16%nResume Key: %20%nStatus: %2 (%1)%nRKF Status: %4 (%3)%nDurable: %17%nResilient: %18%nPersistent: %19%nReason: %21%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe client attempted to reopen a continuously available handle, but the attempt failed.

This typically indicates a problem with the storage and not SMB.\r\n
0xb00003fd | LmCompatibilityLevel value is different from the default.%n%nConfigured LM Compatibility Level: %1%nDefault LM Compatibility Level: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nLAN Manager (LM) authentication is the protocol used to authenticate Windows clients for network operations. This includes joining a domain, accessing network resources, and authenticating users or computers. This determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is negotiated between the client and the server computers. Specifically, the LM authentication level determines which authentication protocols the client will try to negotiate or the server will accept. The value set for LmCompatibilityLevel determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This value affects the level of authentication protocol that clients use, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.%n%nValue (Setting) - Description%n%n0 (Send LM & NTLM responses) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n1 (Send LM & NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n2 (Send NTLM response only) - Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n3 (Send NTLM v2 response only) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n4 (Send NTLMv2 response only/refuse LM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n5 (Send NTLM v2 response only/refuse LM & NTLM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM and accept only NTLMv2 authentication.%n%nIncompatibly configured  LmCompatibility levels between a client and server (such as 0 on a client and 5 on a server) prevent access to the server. Non-Microsoft clients and servers also provide these configuration settings.\r\n
0xb00003fe | File and printer sharing firewall rule enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that has custom shares configured.\r\n
0xb00003ff | One or more shares present on this server have access based enumeration enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when enabling access-based enumeration on one or more shares by using either Server Manager or the Set-SmbShare Windows PowerShell cmdlet. Access-based enumeration can raise CPU utilization when clients connect to shares with folders containing many peer-level resources to which a user does not have access. You can control the CPU utilization by configuring the ABELevel value in the Windows registry:%n%nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\ABELevel [DWORD]%n%nYou can set the value for ABELevel to greater depths to minimize CPU overhead, but doing so diminishes the effectiveness of access-based enumeration:%n%nValue = 0: access-based enumeration is enabled for all levels%n%nValue = 1: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 1 (example: \server\share)%n%nValue = 2: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 2 (example: \server\share\folder)%n%nYou can continue setting values for multiple depth levels.\r\n
0xb0000400 | SMB2 and SMB3 have been disabled on this server.  This results in reduced functionality and performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: Smb2%nDefault Value: 1 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: 0%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB2/SMB3. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB2/SMB3. When SMB3 is disabled, you cannot use features such as SMB Transparent Failover, SMB Scale Out, SMB Multichannel, SMB Direct (RDMA), SMB Encryption, VSS for SMB file shares, and SMB Directory Leasing. In most scenarios, SMB provides a troubleshooting workaround as an alternative to disabling SMB2/SMB3. Use the Set-SmbServerConfiguration Windows PowerShell cmdlet to enable SMB2/SMB3.\r\n
0xb0000401 | One or more named pipes or shares have been marked for access by anonymous users.  This increases the security risk of the computer by allowing unauthenticated users to connect to this server.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Values: NullSessionPipes, NullSessionShares%nDefault Value: Empty (or not present)%nCurrent Value: Non-empty%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when modifying the default values of NullSessionShares and NullSessionPipes. On a typical file server, these settings do not exist or do not contain values, which is the most secure configuration. By default, domain controllers populate the NullSessionShares entry with netlogon, samr, and lsarpc to allow legacy access methods.\r\n
0xb0000402 | File leasing has been disabled for the SMB2 and SMB3 protocols.  This reduces functionality and can decrease performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: DisableLeasing%nDefault Value: 0 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: non-zero%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB 3 Leasing. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB Leasing. Once disabled, traffic from client to server may increase since metadata and data may no longer be retrieved from a local cache.\r\n
0xb0000403 | The file and printer sharing firewall ports are currently closed.  This is the default configuration for a system that is not sharing content or is on a Public network.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is not configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that does not have custom shares configured. Clients cannot access SMB shares on this computer until SMB traffic is allowed through the firewall.\r\n
0xb0000404 | The maximum cluster-supported SMB dialect has changed.%n%nNewMaxDialect: %1%nOldMaxDialect: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event during a Windows Failover Cluster upgrade. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb0000405 | The Cipher Suite Order group policy setting is invalid.%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that an administrator has configured an invalid value for the "Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Network\Lanman Server\Cipher Suite Order" group policy setting. The server will use the default cipher suite order "%1" until this error is resolved.\r\n
0xb0000406 | An MDL read or write completion request failed.%n%nServer Name: %2%nShare Name: %4%nFile Name: %6%nIsRead: %7%nStatus: %8%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe SMB server sends MDL completion requests to a file system upon completion of a buffered I/O to release system resources. The file system and its filter drivers must not fail MDL completion requests. Failures may result in memory leaks and degraded system performance and stability. Non-Microsoft file system filter drivers are the most common cause of failed MDL completion requests.\r\n
0xb0000407 | The server detected a problem and has captured a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%nDump Location: %SystemRoot%\LiveKernelReports%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n
0xb0000408 | The server detected a problem but was unable to capture a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected. In this case, the server's request to create a live kernel dump was rejected. This is usually due to the live kernel dump throttle, which prevents frequent dumps from consuming too much disk space. Either wait for the throttle limit to expire (by default, 7 days), or contact Microsoft Support for steps to override the throttle. This event is written to the log no more than once per day. The problem that caused the server to the request a live kernel dump may be occuring more frequently.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n

0xb00003ee | The share denied access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %10%nClient Address: %6%nUser Name: %8%nSession ID: %17%nShare Name: %2%nShare Path: %4%nStatus: %16 (%15)%nMapped Access: %11%nGranted Access: %12%nSecurity Descriptor: %14%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect access denied errors when a principal accesses a share without the necessary permissions. Usually, this indicates that the principal does not have direct security permissions or lacks membership in a group that has direct access permissions. To determine and correct the permissions on the specified share, an administrator can use the Security tab in File Explorer Properties dialog, the SMBSHARE Windows PowerShell module, or the NET SHARE command. You can also use the Effective Access tab in File Explorer to help diagnose the issue.%n%nApplications may generate access denied errors if they attempt to open files in a writable mode first, and then reopen the files in a read-only mode. In this case, no user action is required.%n%nIf access to the share is denied and this event is not logged, you can examine the file and folder NTFS/REFS permissions.%n%nThis error does not indicate a problem with authentication, only authorization.\r\n
0xb00003ef | The share denied anonymous access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %8%nClient Address: %6%nShare Name: %2%nShare Path: %4%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when a client attempts to connect to shares and does not provide any credentials. This indicates that the client is not providing a user name (and domain credentials, if necessary). By default, anonymous access to shares is denied.%n%nThis error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.\r\n
0xb00003f1 | The server denied anonymous access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %4%n Client Address: %2%nSession ID: %5%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when a client attempts to connect to shares and does not provide any credentials.

0xb00003f7 | Decrypt call failed.%n%nClient Name: %2%nClient Address: %4%nSession ID: %7%nStatus: %6 (%5)%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event commonly occurs because a previous SMB session no longer exists. It may also be caused by packets that are altered on the network between the computers due to either errors or a "man-in-the-middle" attack.\r\n
0xb00003f8 | Reopen failed.%n%nClient Name: %7%nClient Address: %9%nUser Name: %13%nSession ID: %14%nShare Name: %11%nFile Name: %16%nResume Key: %20%nStatus: %2 (%1)%nRKF Status: %4 (%3)%nDurable: %17%nResilient: %18%nPersistent: %19%nReason: %21%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe client attempted to reopen a continuously available handle, but the attempt failed. This typically indicates a problem with the network or underlying file being re-opened.\r\n

This typically indicates a problem with the storage and not SMB.\r\n
0xb00003fd | LmCompatibilityLevel value is different from the default.%n%nConfigured LM Compatibility Level: %1%nDefault LM Compatibility Level: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nLAN Manager (LM) authentication is the protocol used to authenticate Windows clients for network operations. This includes joining a domain, accessing network resources, and authenticating users or computers. This determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is negotiated between the client and the server computers. Specifically, the LM authentication level determines which authentication protocols the client will try to negotiate or the server will accept. The value set for LmCompatibilityLevel determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This value affects the level of authentication protocol that clients use, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.%n%nValue (Setting) - Description%n%n0 (Send LM & NTLM responses) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n1 (Send LM & NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n2 (Send NTLM response only) - Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n3 (Send NTLM v2 response only) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n4 (Send NTLMv2 response only/refuse LM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n5 (Send NTLM v2 response only/refuse LM & NTLM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM and accept only NTLMv2 authentication.%n%nIncompatibly configured  LmCompatibility levels between a client and server (such as 0 on a client and 5 on a server) prevent access to the server. Non-Microsoft clients and servers also provide these configuration settings.\r\n
0xb00003fe | File and printer sharing firewall rule enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that has custom shares configured.\r\n
0xb00003ff | One or more shares present on this server have access based enumeration enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when enabling access-based enumeration on one or more shares by using either Server Manager or the Set-SmbShare Windows PowerShell cmdlet. Access-based enumeration can raise CPU utilization when clients connect to shares with folders containing many peer-level resources to which a user does not have access. You can control the CPU utilization by configuring the ABELevel value in the Windows registry:%n%nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\ABELevel [DWORD]%n%nYou can set the value for ABELevel to greater depths to minimize CPU overhead, but doing so diminishes the effectiveness of access-based enumeration:%n%nValue = 0: access-based enumeration is enabled for all levels%n%nValue = 1: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 1 (example: \server\share)%n%nValue = 2: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 2 (example: \server\share\folder)%n%nYou can continue setting values for multiple depth levels.\r\n
0xb0000400 | SMB2 and SMB3 have been disabled on this server.  This results in reduced functionality and performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: Smb2%nDefault Value: 1 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: 0%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB2/SMB3. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB2/SMB3. When SMB3 is disabled, you cannot use features such as SMB Transparent Failover, SMB Scale Out, SMB Multichannel, SMB Direct (RDMA), SMB Encryption, VSS for SMB file shares, and SMB Directory Leasing. In most scenarios, SMB provides a troubleshooting workaround as an alternative to disabling SMB2/SMB3. Use the Set-SmbServerConfiguration Windows PowerShell cmdlet to enable SMB2/SMB3.\r\n
0xb0000401 | One or more named pipes or shares have been marked for access by anonymous users.  This increases the security risk of the computer by allowing unauthenticated users to connect to this server.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Values: NullSessionPipes, NullSessionShares%nDefault Value: Empty (or not present)%nCurrent Value: Non-empty%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when modifying the default values of NullSessionShares and NullSessionPipes. On a typical file server, these settings do not exist or do not contain values, which is the most secure configuration. By default, domain controllers populate the NullSessionShares entry with netlogon, samr, and lsarpc to allow legacy access methods.\r\n
0xb0000402 | File leasing has been disabled for the SMB2 and SMB3 protocols.  This reduces functionality and can decrease performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: DisableLeasing%nDefault Value: 0 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: non-zero%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB 3 Leasing. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB Leasing. Once disabled, traffic from client to server may increase since metadata and data may no longer be retrieved from a local cache.\r\n
0xb0000403 | The file and printer sharing firewall ports are currently closed.  This is the default configuration for a system that is not sharing content or is on a Public network.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is not configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that does not have custom shares configured. Clients cannot access SMB shares on this computer until SMB traffic is allowed through the firewall.\r\n
0xb0000404 | The maximum cluster-supported SMB dialect has changed.%n%nNewMaxDialect: %1%nOldMaxDialect: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event during a Windows Failover Cluster upgrade. No user action is required.\r\n

0xb0000406 | An MDL read or write completion request failed.%n%nServer Name: %2%nShare Name: %4%nFile Name: %6%nIsRead: %7%nStatus: %8%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe SMB server sends MDL completion requests to a file system upon completion of a buffered I/O to release system resources. The file system and its filter drivers must not fail MDL completion requests. Failures may result in memory leaks and degraded system performance and stability. Non-Microsoft file system filter drivers are the most common cause of failed MDL completion requests.\r\n
0xb0000407 | The server detected a problem and has captured a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%nDump Location: %SystemRoot%\LiveKernelReports%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n
0xb0000408 | The server detected a problem but was unable to capture a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected. In this case, the server's request to create a live kernel dump was rejected. This is usually due to the live kernel dump throttle, which prevents frequent dumps from consuming too much disk space. Either wait for the throttle limit to expire (by default, 7 days), or contact Microsoft Support for steps to override the throttle. This event is written to the log no more than once per day. The problem that caused the server to the request a live kernel dump may be occuring more frequently.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem.

This typically indicates a problem with the storage and not SMB.\r\n
0xb00003fd | LmCompatibilityLevel value is different from the default.%n%nConfigured LM Compatibility Level: %1%nDefault LM Compatibility Level: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nLAN Manager (LM) authentication is the protocol used to authenticate Windows clients for network operations. This includes joining a domain, accessing network resources, and authenticating users or computers. This determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is negotiated between the client and the server computers. Specifically, the LM authentication level determines which authentication protocols the client will try to negotiate or the server will accept. The value set for LmCompatibilityLevel determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This value affects the level of authentication protocol that clients use, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.%n%nValue (Setting) - Description%n%n0 (Send LM & NTLM responses) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n1 (Send LM & NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n2 (Send NTLM response only) - Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n3 (Send NTLM v2 response only) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n4 (Send NTLMv2 response only/refuse LM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n5 (Send NTLM v2 response only/refuse LM & NTLM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM and accept only NTLMv2 authentication.%n%nIncompatibly configured  LmCompatibility levels between a client and server (such as 0 on a client and 5 on a server) prevent access to the server. Non-Microsoft clients and servers also provide these configuration settings.\r\n
0xb00003fe | File and printer sharing firewall rule enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that has custom shares configured.\r\n
0xb00003ff | One or more shares present on this server have access based enumeration enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when enabling access-based enumeration on one or more shares by using either Server Manager or the Set-SmbShare Windows PowerShell cmdlet. Access-based enumeration can raise CPU utilization when clients connect to shares with folders containing many peer-level resources to which a user does not have access. You can control the CPU utilization by configuring the ABELevel value in the Windows registry:%n%nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\ABELevel [DWORD]%n%nYou can set the value for ABELevel to greater depths to minimize CPU overhead, but doing so diminishes the effectiveness of access-based enumeration:%n%nValue = 0: access-based enumeration is enabled for all levels%n%nValue = 1: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 1 (example: \server\share)%n%nValue = 2: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 2 (example: \server\share\folder)%n%nYou can continue setting values for multiple depth levels.\r\n
0xb0000400 | SMB2 and SMB3 have been disabled on this server.  This results in reduced functionality and performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: Smb2%nDefault Value: 1 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: 0%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB2/SMB3. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB2/SMB3. When SMB3 is disabled, you cannot use features such as SMB Transparent Failover, SMB Scale Out, SMB Multichannel, SMB Direct (RDMA), SMB Encryption, VSS for SMB file shares, and SMB Directory Leasing. In most scenarios, SMB provides a troubleshooting workaround as an alternative to disabling SMB2/SMB3. Use the Set-SmbServerConfiguration Windows PowerShell cmdlet to enable SMB2/SMB3.\r\n
0xb0000401 | One or more named pipes or shares have been marked for access by anonymous users.  This increases the security risk of the computer by allowing unauthenticated users to connect to this server.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Values: NullSessionPipes, NullSessionShares%nDefault Value: Empty (or not present)%nCurrent Value: Non-empty%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when modifying the default values of NullSessionShares and NullSessionPipes. On a typical file server, these settings do not exist or do not contain values, which is the most secure configuration. By default, domain controllers populate the NullSessionShares entry with netlogon, samr, and lsarpc to allow legacy access methods.\r\n
0xb0000402 | File leasing has been disabled for the SMB2 and SMB3 protocols.  This reduces functionality and can decrease performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: DisableLeasing%nDefault Value: 0 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: non-zero%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB 3 Leasing. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB Leasing. Once disabled, traffic from client to server may increase since metadata and data may no longer be retrieved from a local cache.\r\n
0xb0000403 | The file and printer sharing firewall ports are currently closed.  This is the default configuration for a system that is not sharing content or is on a Public network.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is not configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that does not have custom shares configured. Clients cannot access SMB shares on this computer until SMB traffic is allowed through the firewall.\r\n
0xb0000404 | The maximum cluster-supported SMB dialect has changed.%n%nNewMaxDialect: %1%nOldMaxDialect: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event during a Windows Failover Cluster upgrade. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb0000405 | The Cipher Suite Order group policy setting is invalid.%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that an administrator has configured an invalid value for the "Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Network\Lanman Server\Cipher Suite Order" group policy setting. The server will use the default cipher suite order "%1" until this error is resolved.\r\n
0xb0000406 | An MDL read or write completion request failed.%n%nServer Name: %2%nShare Name: %4%nFile Name: %6%nIsRead: %7%nStatus: %8%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe SMB server sends MDL completion requests to a file system upon completion of a buffered I/O to release system resources. The file system and its filter drivers must not fail MDL completion requests. Failures may result in memory leaks and degraded system performance and stability. Non-Microsoft file system filter drivers are the most common cause of failed MDL completion requests.\r\n
0xb0000407 | The server detected a problem and has captured a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%nDump Location: %SystemRoot%\LiveKernelReports%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n
0xb0000408 | The server detected a problem but was unable to capture a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected. In this case, the server's request to create a live kernel dump was rejected. This is usually due to the live kernel dump throttle, which prevents frequent dumps from consuming too much disk space. Either wait for the throttle limit to expire (by default, 7 days), or contact Microsoft Support for steps to override the throttle. This event is written to the log no more than once per day. The problem that caused the server to the request a live kernel dump may be occuring more frequently.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n

Usually, this indicates that the principal does not have direct security permissions or lacks membership in a group that has direct access permissions. To determine and correct the permissions on the specified share, an administrator can use the Security tab in File Explorer Properties dialog, the SMBSHARE Windows PowerShell module, or the NET SHARE command. You can also use the Effective Access tab in File Explorer to help diagnose the issue.%n%nApplications may generate access denied errors if they attempt to open files in a writable mode first, and then reopen the files in a read-only mode. In this case, no user action is required.%n%nIf access to the share is denied and this event is not logged, you can examine the file and folder NTFS/REFS permissions.%n%nThis error does not indicate a problem with authentication, only authorization.\r\n
0xb00003ef | The share denied anonymous access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %8%nClient Address: %6%nShare Name: %2%nShare Path: %4%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when a client attempts to connect to shares and does not provide any credentials. This indicates that the client is not providing a user name (and domain credentials, if necessary). By default, anonymous access to shares is denied.%n%nThis error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.\r\n

0xb00003fd | LmCompatibilityLevel value is different from the default.%n%nConfigured LM Compatibility Level: %1%nDefault LM Compatibility Level: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nLAN Manager (LM) authentication is the protocol used to authenticate Windows clients for network operations. This includes joining a domain, accessing network resources, and authenticating users or computers. This determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is negotiated between the client and the server computers. Specifically, the LM authentication level determines which authentication protocols the client will try to negotiate or the server will accept. The value set for LmCompatibilityLevel determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This value affects the level of authentication protocol that clients use, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.%n%nValue (Setting) - Description%n%n0 (Send LM & NTLM responses) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n1 (Send LM & NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n2 (Send NTLM response only) - Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n3 (Send NTLM v2 response only) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n4 (Send NTLMv2 response only/refuse LM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n5 (Send NTLM v2 response only/refuse LM & NTLM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM and accept only NTLMv2 authentication.%n%nIncompatibly configured  LmCompatibility levels between a client and server (such as 0 on a client and 5 on a server) prevent access to the server. Non-Microsoft clients and servers also provide these configuration settings.\r\n
0xb00003fe | File and printer sharing firewall rule enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that has custom shares configured.\r\n
0xb00003ff | One or more shares present on this server have access based enumeration enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when enabling access-based enumeration on one or more shares by using either Server Manager or the Set-SmbShare Windows PowerShell cmdlet. Access-based enumeration can raise CPU utilization when clients connect to shares with folders containing many peer-level resources to which a user does not have access. You can control the CPU utilization by configuring the ABELevel value in the Windows registry:%n%nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\ABELevel [DWORD]%n%nYou can set the value for ABELevel to greater depths to minimize CPU overhead, but doing so diminishes the effectiveness of access-based enumeration:%n%nValue = 0: access-based enumeration is enabled for all levels%n%nValue = 1: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 1 (example: \server\share)%n%nValue = 2: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 2 (example: \server\share\folder)%n%nYou can continue setting values for multiple depth levels.\r\n
0xb0000400 | SMB2 and SMB3 have been disabled on this server.  This results in reduced functionality and performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: Smb2%nDefault Value: 1 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: 0%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB2/SMB3. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB2/SMB3. When SMB3 is disabled, you cannot use features such as SMB Transparent Failover, SMB Scale Out, SMB Multichannel, SMB Direct (RDMA), SMB Encryption, VSS for SMB file shares, and SMB Directory Leasing. In most scenarios, SMB provides a troubleshooting workaround as an alternative to disabling SMB2/SMB3. Use the Set-SmbServerConfiguration Windows PowerShell cmdlet to enable SMB2/SMB3.\r\n
0xb0000401 | One or more named pipes or shares have been marked for access by anonymous users.  This increases the security risk of the computer by allowing unauthenticated users to connect to this server.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Values: NullSessionPipes, NullSessionShares%nDefault Value: Empty (or not present)%nCurrent Value: Non-empty%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when modifying the default values of NullSessionShares and NullSessionPipes. On a typical file server, these settings do not exist or do not contain values, which is the most secure configuration. By default, domain controllers populate the NullSessionShares entry with netlogon, samr, and lsarpc to allow legacy access methods.\r\n
0xb0000402 | File leasing has been disabled for the SMB2 and SMB3 protocols.  This reduces functionality and can decrease performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: DisableLeasing%nDefault Value: 0 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: non-zero%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB 3 Leasing. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB Leasing. Once disabled, traffic from client to server may increase since metadata and data may no longer be retrieved from a local cache.\r\n
0xb0000403 | The file and printer sharing firewall ports are currently closed.  This is the default configuration for a system that is not sharing content or is on a Public network.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is not configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that does not have custom shares configured. Clients cannot access SMB shares on this computer until SMB traffic is allowed through the firewall.\r\n
0xb0000404 | The maximum cluster-supported SMB dialect has changed.%n%nNewMaxDialect: %1%nOldMaxDialect: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event during a Windows Failover Cluster upgrade. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb0000405 | The Cipher Suite Order group policy setting is invalid.%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that an administrator has configured an invalid value for the "Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Network\Lanman Server\Cipher Suite Order" group policy setting. The server will use the default cipher suite order "%1" until this error is resolved.\r\n
0xb0000406 | An MDL read or write completion request failed.%n%nServer Name: %2%nShare Name: %4%nFile Name: %6%nIsRead: %7%nStatus: %8%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe SMB server sends MDL completion requests to a file system upon completion of a buffered I/O to release system resources. The file system and its filter drivers must not fail MDL completion requests. Failures may result in memory leaks and degraded system performance and stability. Non-Microsoft file system filter drivers are the most common cause of failed MDL completion requests.\r\n
0xb0000407 | The server detected a problem and has captured a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%nDump Location: %SystemRoot%\LiveKernelReports%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n
0xb0000408 | The server detected a problem but was unable to capture a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected. In this case, the server's request to create a live kernel dump was rejected. This is usually due to the live kernel dump throttle, which prevents frequent dumps from consuming too much disk space. Either wait for the throttle limit to expire (by default, 7 days), or contact Microsoft Support for steps to override the throttle. This event is written to the log no more than once per day. The problem that caused the server to the request a live kernel dump may be occuring more frequently.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n

0xb00003ee | The share denied access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %10%nClient Address: %6%nUser Name: %8%nSession ID: %17%nShare Name: %2%nShare Path: %4%nStatus: %16 (%15)%nMapped Access: %11%nGranted Access: %12%nSecurity Descriptor: %14%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect access denied errors when a principal accesses a share without the necessary permissions. Usually, this indicates that the principal does not have direct security permissions or lacks membership in a group that has direct access permissions. To determine and correct the permissions on the specified share, an administrator can use the Security tab in File Explorer Properties dialog, the SMBSHARE Windows PowerShell module, or the NET SHARE command. You can also use the Effective Access tab in File Explorer to help diagnose the issue.%n%nApplications may generate access denied errors if they attempt to open files in a writable mode first, and then reopen the files in a read-only mode. In this case, no user action is required.%n%nIf access to the share is denied and this event is not logged, you can examine the file and folder NTFS/REFS permissions.%n%nThis error does not indicate a problem with authentication, only authorization.\r\n
0xb00003ef | The share denied anonymous access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %8%nClient Address: %6%nShare Name: %2%nShare Path: %4%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when a client attempts to connect to shares and does not provide any credentials. This indicates that the client is not providing a user name (and domain credentials, if necessary). By default, anonymous access to shares is denied.%n%nThis error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.\r\n
0xb00003f1 | The server denied anonymous access to the client.%n%nClient Name: %4%n Client Address: %2%nSession ID: %5%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when a client attempts to connect to shares and does not provide any credentials. This indicates that the client is not providing a user name (and domain credentials, if necessary). By default, Windows Server denies anonymous access to shares.%n%nThis error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.\r\n
0xb00003f2 | Endpoint added.%n%nName: %2%nDomain Name: %4%nTransport Name: %6%nTransport Flags: %7%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when the server starts listening on an interface, such as during system restart or when enabling a network adaptor. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f3 | Endpoint removed.%n%nName: %2%nDomain Name: %4%nTransport Name: %6%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when the server stops listening on an interface, such as during shutdown or when disabling a network adaptor. No user action is required.\r\n

No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f5 | Endpoint coming online.%n%nEndpoint Name: %2%nTransport Name: %4%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event on a Windows Failover Cluster node during failover operations. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f6 | Endpoint going offline.%n%nEndpoint Name: %2%nTransport Name: %4%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event on a Windows Failover Cluster node during failover operations. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb00003f7 | Decrypt call failed.%n%nClient Name: %2%nClient Address: %4%nSession ID: %7%nStatus: %6 (%5)%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event commonly occurs because a previous SMB session no longer exists. It may also be caused by packets that are altered on the network between the computers due to either errors or a "man-in-the-middle" attack.\r\n
0xb00003f8 | Reopen failed.%n%nClient Name: %7%nClient Address: %9%nUser Name: %13%nSession ID: %14%nShare Name: %11%nFile Name: %16%nResume Key: %20%nStatus: %2 (%1)%nRKF Status: %4 (%3)%nDurable: %17%nResilient: %18%nPersistent: %19%nReason: %21%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe client attempted to reopen a continuously available handle, but the attempt failed. This typically indicates a problem with the network or underlying file being re-opened.\r\n
0xb00003f9 | Handle scavenged.%n%nShare Name: %7%nFile Name: %9%nResume Key: %5%nPersistent File ID: %3%nVolatile File ID: %4%nDurable: %1%nResilient or Persistent: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server closed a handle that was previously reserved for a client after 60 seconds. You should expect this event on a computer that is continuously available where a client did not gracefully close its session. For instance, this may occur when the client unexpectedly restarted.\r\n
0xb00003fa | Backchannel invalidation of session completed.%n%nSession ID: %1%nStatus: %3 (%2)%nTask Status: %5 (%4)%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event on a computer that is continuously available. No user action is required\r\n
0xb00003fb | Backchannel invalidation of file completed.%n%nResume Key: %1%nStatus: %3 (%2)%nTask Status: %5 (%4)%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event on a computer that is continuously available. No user action is required\r\n

This typically indicates a problem with the storage and not SMB.\r\n
0xb00003fd | LmCompatibilityLevel value is different from the default.%n%nConfigured LM Compatibility Level: %1%nDefault LM Compatibility Level: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nLAN Manager (LM) authentication is the protocol used to authenticate Windows clients for network operations. This includes joining a domain, accessing network resources, and authenticating users or computers. This determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is negotiated between the client and the server computers. Specifically, the LM authentication level determines which authentication protocols the client will try to negotiate or the server will accept. The value set for LmCompatibilityLevel determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This value affects the level of authentication protocol that clients use, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.%n%nValue (Setting) - Description%n%n0 (Send LM & NTLM responses) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n1 (Send LM & NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n2 (Send NTLM response only) - Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n3 (Send NTLM v2 response only) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n4 (Send NTLMv2 response only/refuse LM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n5 (Send NTLM v2 response only/refuse LM & NTLM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM and accept only NTLMv2 authentication.%n%nIncompatibly configured  LmCompatibility levels between a client and server (such as 0 on a client and 5 on a server) prevent access to the server. Non-Microsoft clients and servers also provide these configuration settings.\r\n
0xb00003fe | File and printer sharing firewall rule enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that has custom shares configured.\r\n
0xb00003ff | One or more shares present on this server have access based enumeration enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when enabling access-based enumeration on one or more shares by using either Server Manager or the Set-SmbShare Windows PowerShell cmdlet. Access-based enumeration can raise CPU utilization when clients connect to shares with folders containing many peer-level resources to which a user does not have access. You can control the CPU utilization by configuring the ABELevel value in the Windows registry:%n%nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\ABELevel [DWORD]%n%nYou can set the value for ABELevel to greater depths to minimize CPU overhead, but doing so diminishes the effectiveness of access-based enumeration:%n%nValue = 0: access-based enumeration is enabled for all levels%n%nValue = 1: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 1 (example: \server\share)%n%nValue = 2: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 2 (example: \server\share\folder)%n%nYou can continue setting values for multiple depth levels.\r\n
0xb0000400 | SMB2 and SMB3 have been disabled on this server.  This results in reduced functionality and performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: Smb2%nDefault Value: 1 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: 0%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB2/SMB3. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB2/SMB3. When SMB3 is disabled, you cannot use features such as SMB Transparent Failover, SMB Scale Out, SMB Multichannel, SMB Direct (RDMA), SMB Encryption, VSS for SMB file shares, and SMB Directory Leasing. In most scenarios, SMB provides a troubleshooting workaround as an alternative to disabling SMB2/SMB3. Use the Set-SmbServerConfiguration Windows PowerShell cmdlet to enable SMB2/SMB3.\r\n
0xb0000401 | One or more named pipes or shares have been marked for access by anonymous users.  This increases the security risk of the computer by allowing unauthenticated users to connect to this server.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Values: NullSessionPipes, NullSessionShares%nDefault Value: Empty (or not present)%nCurrent Value: Non-empty%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when modifying the default values of NullSessionShares and NullSessionPipes. On a typical file server, these settings do not exist or do not contain values, which is the most secure configuration. By default, domain controllers populate the NullSessionShares entry with netlogon, samr, and lsarpc to allow legacy access methods.\r\n
0xb0000402 | File leasing has been disabled for the SMB2 and SMB3 protocols.  This reduces functionality and can decrease performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: DisableLeasing%nDefault Value: 0 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: non-zero%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB 3 Leasing. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB Leasing. Once disabled, traffic from client to server may increase since metadata and data may no longer be retrieved from a local cache.\r\n
0xb0000403 | The file and printer sharing firewall ports are currently closed.  This is the default configuration for a system that is not sharing content or is on a Public network.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is not configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that does not have custom shares configured. Clients cannot access SMB shares on this computer until SMB traffic is allowed through the firewall.\r\n
0xb0000404 | The maximum cluster-supported SMB dialect has changed.%n%nNewMaxDialect: %1%nOldMaxDialect: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event during a Windows Failover Cluster upgrade. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb0000405 | The Cipher Suite Order group policy setting is invalid.%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that an administrator has configured an invalid value for the "Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Network\Lanman Server\Cipher Suite Order" group policy setting. The server will use the default cipher suite order "%1" until this error is resolved.\r\n
0xb0000406 | An MDL read or write completion request failed.%n%nServer Name: %2%nShare Name: %4%nFile Name: %6%nIsRead: %7%nStatus: %8%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe SMB server sends MDL completion requests to a file system upon completion of a buffered I/O to release system resources. The file system and its filter drivers must not fail MDL completion requests. Failures may result in memory leaks and degraded system performance and stability. Non-Microsoft file system filter drivers are the most common cause of failed MDL completion requests.\r\n
0xb0000407 | The server detected a problem and has captured a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%nDump Location: %SystemRoot%\LiveKernelReports%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n
0xb0000408 | The server detected a problem but was unable to capture a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected. In this case, the server's request to create a live kernel dump was rejected. This is usually due to the live kernel dump throttle, which prevents frequent dumps from consuming too much disk space. Either wait for the throttle limit to expire (by default, 7 days), or contact Microsoft Support for steps to override the throttle. This event is written to the log no more than once per day. The problem that caused the server to the request a live kernel dump may be occuring more frequently.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n

0xb0000413 | RDMA connection disconnected.%n%nTransport name: %3%nMilliseconds spent closing the connection: %1%n%nGuidance:%n%nClosing an RDMA connection should not take longer than 2 minutes. An RDMA IO that takes an abnormally long time to complete indicates a problem with the RDMA network adapters on this computer or its remote host. Contact your RDMA vendor for an updated driver and further troubleshooting.\r\n
0xb0000414 | Quic connection shutdown.%n%nError: %1%nReason: %2%nEndpoint Name: %4%nTransport Name: %6%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that the winquic connection is shuting down by the server. This event commonly occurs because the server certificate mapping is not created. It may also be caused by the server failed to configure the winquic connections.\r\n
0xb0000415 | The server failed to update server certificate mapping.%n%nName: %2%nSubject: %4%nThumbprint: %6%n%nThe certificate can't be used for the server due to error %7%n%nThe server certificate mapping %9 removed.\r\n

0xb0010227 | SMB Session Authentication Failure%n%nClient Name: %11%nClient Address: %6%nUser Name: %9%nSession ID: %7%nStatus: %4 (%3)%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this error when attempting to connect to shares using incorrect credentials.%n%nThis error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.%n%nThis error can occur when using incorrect usernames and passwords with NTLM, mismatched LmCompatibility settings between client and server, duplicate Kerberos service principal names, incorrect Kerberos ticket-granting service tickets, or Guest accounts without Guest access enabled\r\n
0xb00103e9 | A client attempted to access the server using SMB1 and was rejected because SMB1 file sharing support is disabled or has been uninstalled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nAn administrator has disabled or uninstalled server support for SMB1. Clients running Windows XP / Windows Server 2003 R2 and earlier will not be able to access this server. Clients running Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 and later no longer require SMB1. To determine which clients are attempting to access this server using SMB1, use the Windows PowerShell cmdlet Set-SmbServerConfiguration to enable SMB1 access auditing.\r\n

Usually, this indicates that the principal does not have direct security permissions or lacks membership in a group that has direct access permissions. To determine and correct the permissions on the specified share, an administrator can use the Security tab in File Explorer Properties dialog, the SMBSHARE Windows PowerShell module, or the NET SHARE command. You can also use the Effective Access tab in File Explorer to help diagnose the issue.%n%nApplications may generate access denied errors if they attempt to open files in a writable mode first, and then reopen the files in a read-only mode. In this case, no user action is required.%n%nIf access to the share is denied and this event is not logged, you can examine the file and folder NTFS/REFS permissions.%n%nThis error does not indicate a problem with authentication, only authorization.\r\n

0xb00003f7 | Decrypt call failed.%n%nClient Name: %2%nClient Address: %4%nSession ID: %7%nStatus: %6 (%5)%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event commonly occurs because a previous SMB session no longer exists. It may also be caused by packets that are altered on the network between the computers due to either errors or a "man-in-the-middle" attack.\r\n
0xb00003f8 | Reopen failed.%n%nClient Name: %7%nClient Address: %9%nUser Name: %13%nSession ID: %14%nShare Name: %11%nFile Name: %16%nResume Key: %20%nStatus: %2 (%1)%nRKF Status: %4 (%3)%nDurable: %17%nResilient: %18%nPersistent: %19%nReason: %21%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe client attempted to reopen a continuously available handle, but the attempt failed.

This typically indicates a problem with the storage and not SMB.\r\n
0xb00003fd | LmCompatibilityLevel value is different from the default.%n%nConfigured LM Compatibility Level: %1%nDefault LM Compatibility Level: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nLAN Manager (LM) authentication is the protocol used to authenticate Windows clients for network operations. This includes joining a domain, accessing network resources, and authenticating users or computers. This determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is negotiated between the client and the server computers. Specifically, the LM authentication level determines which authentication protocols the client will try to negotiate or the server will accept. The value set for LmCompatibilityLevel determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This value affects the level of authentication protocol that clients use, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.%n%nValue (Setting) - Description%n%n0 (Send LM & NTLM responses) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n1 (Send LM & NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n2 (Send NTLM response only) - Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n3 (Send NTLM v2 response only) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n4 (Send NTLMv2 response only/refuse LM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication.%n%n5 (Send NTLM v2 response only/refuse LM & NTLM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM and accept only NTLMv2 authentication.%n%nIncompatibly configured  LmCompatibility levels between a client and server (such as 0 on a client and 5 on a server) prevent access to the server. Non-Microsoft clients and servers also provide these configuration settings.\r\n
0xb00003fe | File and printer sharing firewall rule enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that has custom shares configured.\r\n
0xb00003ff | One or more shares present on this server have access based enumeration enabled.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when enabling access-based enumeration on one or more shares by using either Server Manager or the Set-SmbShare Windows PowerShell cmdlet. Access-based enumeration can raise CPU utilization when clients connect to shares with folders containing many peer-level resources to which a user does not have access. You can control the CPU utilization by configuring the ABELevel value in the Windows registry:%n%nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\ABELevel [DWORD]%n%nYou can set the value for ABELevel to greater depths to minimize CPU overhead, but doing so diminishes the effectiveness of access-based enumeration:%n%nValue = 0: access-based enumeration is enabled for all levels%n%nValue = 1: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 1 (example: \server\share)%n%nValue = 2: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 2 (example: \server\share\folder)%n%nYou can continue setting values for multiple depth levels.\r\n
0xb0000400 | SMB2 and SMB3 have been disabled on this server.  This results in reduced functionality and performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: Smb2%nDefault Value: 1 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: 0%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB2/SMB3. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB2/SMB3. When SMB3 is disabled, you cannot use features such as SMB Transparent Failover, SMB Scale Out, SMB Multichannel, SMB Direct (RDMA), SMB Encryption, VSS for SMB file shares, and SMB Directory Leasing. In most scenarios, SMB provides a troubleshooting workaround as an alternative to disabling SMB2/SMB3. Use the Set-SmbServerConfiguration Windows PowerShell cmdlet to enable SMB2/SMB3.\r\n
0xb0000401 | One or more named pipes or shares have been marked for access by anonymous users.  This increases the security risk of the computer by allowing unauthenticated users to connect to this server.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Values: NullSessionPipes, NullSessionShares%nDefault Value: Empty (or not present)%nCurrent Value: Non-empty%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when modifying the default values of NullSessionShares and NullSessionPipes. On a typical file server, these settings do not exist or do not contain values, which is the most secure configuration. By default, domain controllers populate the NullSessionShares entry with netlogon, samr, and lsarpc to allow legacy access methods.\r\n
0xb0000402 | File leasing has been disabled for the SMB2 and SMB3 protocols.  This reduces functionality and can decrease performance.%n%nRegistry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters%nRegistry Value: DisableLeasing%nDefault Value: 0 (or not present)%nCurrent Value: non-zero%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when disabling SMB 3 Leasing. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB Leasing. Once disabled, traffic from client to server may increase since metadata and data may no longer be retrieved from a local cache.\r\n
0xb0000403 | The file and printer sharing firewall ports are currently closed.  This is the default configuration for a system that is not sharing content or is on a Public network.%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event when Windows Firewall is not configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that does not have custom shares configured. Clients cannot access SMB shares on this computer until SMB traffic is allowed through the firewall.\r\n
0xb0000404 | The maximum cluster-supported SMB dialect has changed.%n%nNewMaxDialect: %1%nOldMaxDialect: %2%n%nGuidance:%n%nYou should expect this event during a Windows Failover Cluster upgrade. No user action is required.\r\n
0xb0000405 | The Cipher Suite Order group policy setting is invalid.%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that an administrator has configured an invalid value for the "Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Network\Lanman Server\Cipher Suite Order" group policy setting. The server will use the default cipher suite order "%1" until this error is resolved.\r\n
0xb0000406 | An MDL read or write completion request failed.%n%nServer Name: %2%nShare Name: %4%nFile Name: %6%nIsRead: %7%nStatus: %8%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe SMB server sends MDL completion requests to a file system upon completion of a buffered I/O to release system resources. The file system and its filter drivers must not fail MDL completion requests. Failures may result in memory leaks and degraded system performance and stability. Non-Microsoft file system filter drivers are the most common cause of failed MDL completion requests.\r\n
0xb0000407 | The server detected a problem and has captured a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%nDump Location: %SystemRoot%\LiveKernelReports%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n
0xb0000408 | The server detected a problem but was unable to capture a live kernel dump to collect debug information.%n%nReason: %1%n%nGuidance:%n%nThe server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected. In this case, the server's request to create a live kernel dump was rejected. This is usually due to the live kernel dump throttle, which prevents frequent dumps from consuming too much disk space. Either wait for the throttle limit to expire (by default, 7 days), or contact Microsoft Support for steps to override the throttle. This event is written to the log no more than once per day. The problem that caused the server to the request a live kernel dump may be occuring more frequently.%n%nStalled I/O%n%nAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.\r\n
