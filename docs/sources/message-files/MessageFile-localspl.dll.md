0xc0000020 | While attempting to publish the printer to the Active Directory directory service, the print spooler could not find the appropriate print queue container because the primary domain query failed. Error: %1. This can occur if Domain Name System (DNS) cannot resolve the domain controller IP address, or if the domain controller or directory service is not functioning correctly. The printer is not published in Active Directory and cannot be located by searching Active Directory.\r\n
0xc0000021 | While attempting to publish the printer to the Active Directory directory service, the print spooler could not find the appropriate print queue container because the Domain Name System (DNS) domain name could not be retrieved.

The printer is not published in Active Directory and cannot be located by searching Active Directory.\r\n
0xc000002c | The print spooler could not find the print queue container because the Domain Name System (DNS) server name could not be retrieved.  Error: %1. This might be because DNS cannot resolve the server IP address, or because the domain controller or directory service is not functioning correctly. The printer is not published in the Active Directory directory service and cannot be located by searching Active Directory.\r\n
0xc000002d | The document failed to print because of a Graphical Device Interface (GDI) error or a driver error in rendering the print job. Try printing the document again.\r\n
0xc0000033 | Print queue %1 could not be deleted (pruned) from the Active Directory directory service.  Error: %2. The spooler will periodically try to remove the entry until it is successful. Continued failures may indicate an Active Directory problem, a basic network problem, or a communication problem between the domain controller and the print server.\r\n
0xc0000034 | This version of %1 is incompatible with this version of Windows. Please obtain and install a new version of the driver from the manufacturer (if available), or choose an alternate driver that works with this print device.\r\n
0xc0000035 | The print spooler failed to create a symbolic link between HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Print\\Printers and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Print\\Printers. Error %1. This only affects older applications, but is probably a sign that the system itself is in a poor condition or that the print spooler does not have the proper registry permissions.\r\n
0xc0000036 | Document %1 failed to print and was deleted because of corruption in the spooled file. The associated driver is: %2. Try printing the document again.\r\n
0xc0000037 | The attempt for %1 to use a Windows NT 4.0 (kernel mode) driver failed because this version of Windows does not support Windows NT 4.0 printer drivers. Please obtain and install a new version of the driver from the manufacturer (if available), or choose an alternate driver that works with this print device.\r\n
0xc0000039 | The document failed to print because the user did not have the necessary privileges.\r\n
0xc000003a | %1 initialization failed at %2. Error: %3. This can occur because of system instability or a lack of system resources.\r\n
0xc000003b | The print spooler was not able to add print queue %1 under container %2 in the Active Directory directory service because the cluster access control entry (ACE) could not be added to the print queue security descriptor.

0xc000003c | Failed to install or update driver %1 on cluster spooler resource %2. Win32 error: %3. The printer driver is different from the driver in use on other computers (nodes) in the cluster. This can occur because of a transient failure in replication between nodes, or if the nodes are running Windows 2000 (which does not automatically replicate drivers).\r\n
0xc000003d | The document %1 owned by %2 failed to print on printer %3. Win32 error code returned by the print processor: %4. %5\r\n
0xc000003e | This version of Windows does not support Windows NT 4.0 (kernel mode) printer drivers and cannot accept the %2 driver from the remote server %1. Please obtain and install a new version of the driver from the manufacturer (if available), or choose an alternate driver that works with this print device.\r\n
0xc0000040 | The attempt to install printer %1 into an offline operating system image failed with Win32 error code %2. This can occur if the printer driver requires user input or displays a user interface (UI) during installation.\r\n
0xc0000042 | Printer %1 failed to initialize its ports. Win32 error: %2. This error usually occurs because of a problem with the port monitor. Try recreating the port using a standard TCP/IP printer port, if possible. This problem does not affect other printers.\r\n
0xc0000043 | The print spooler failed to cache print connection %1. This can occur because there are insufficient system resources. No user action is required.\r\n
0xc0000044 | The print spooler %1 failed to start. To determine the cause of this error, examine the preceding events in the Event Log.\r\n
0xc0000045 | Windows could not load print processor %1 because EnumDatatypes did not return any data. Module: %2. Please obtain and install a new version of the driver from the manufacturer (if available), or choose an alternate driver that works with this print device.\r\n
0xc0000046 | Windows could not load print processor %1 because EnumDatatypes failed. Error code %2. Module: %3. Please obtain and install a new version of the driver from the manufacturer (if available), or choose an alternate driver that works with this print device.\r\n
0xc0000047 | The print server security descriptor for %1 is invalid. The default print server security descriptor will be used.\r\n
0xc0000048 | Windows could not initialize printer %1 because the print processor %2 could not be found. Please obtain and install a new version of the driver from the manufacturer (if available), or choose an alternate driver that works with this print device.\r\n
0xc0000049 | The print spooler failed to verify printer driver package %1 for environment %2. Win32 system error code %3. This can occur after an operating system upgrade or because of data loss on the hard drive. The print spooler will try to regenerate the driver information from the driver store, which is where drivers are saved before they are installed. No user action is required.\r\n
0xc000004a | The print spooler failed to verify printer driver package for environment %1. Win32 system error code %2. This can occur because of insufficient memory or other system failures. No user action is required.\r\n
0xc000004b | The print spooler failed to regenerate the printer driver information for driver %1 for environment %2. Win32 system error code %3. This can occur after an operating system upgrade or because of data loss on the hard drive.\r\n
0xc000004c | The print spooler failed to unshare printer %2 which is shared as %3. Error %1.\r\n
0xc0001811 | The document %1, owned by %2, failed to print on printer %3. Try to print the document again, or restart the print spooler. %nData type: %4. Size of the spool file in bytes: %5. Number of bytes printed: %6. Total number of pages in the document: %7. Number of pages printed: %8. Client computer: %9. Win32 error code returned by the print processor: %10. %11\r\n
0xc0001812 | The spooler has detected that a component has an unusually large number of open Graphical Device Interface (GDI) objects. As a result, some enhanced metafile (EMF) print jobs might not print until the spooler is restarted.\r\n
