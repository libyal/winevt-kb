0x4000c350 | Attempts to diagnose heavily damaged ReFS volumes, identify remaining files,\r\nand copy those files to another volume.\r\n\r\nReFS Salvage has a Scan Phase and a Copy Phase.  In automatic mode, the Scan\r\nPhase and Copy Phase will run sequentially.  In manual mode, each phase can be\r\nrun separately.  Progress and logs are saved in a working directory to allow\r\nphases to be run separately as well as Scan Phase to be paused and resumed.\r\n\r\nHere are the automatic mode Command Line Usages:\r\n\r\nQuick Automatic Mode Command Line Usage:\r\n   refsutil salvage -QA <source volume> <working directory> <target directory> <options>\r\n\r\n   It will perform a Quick Scan Phase followed by a Copy Phase.\r\n   This mode runs quicker as it assumes some critical structures of the volume\r\n   are not corrupted and so there is no need to scan the entire volume to\r\n   locate them.  This also reduces the recovery of stale files/directories/volumes.\r\n\r\nFull Automatic Mode Command Line Usage:\r\n   refsutil salvage -FA <source volume> <working directory> <target directory> <options>\r\n\r\n   It will perform a Full Scan Phase followed by a Copy Phase.\r\n   This mode may take a long time as it will scan the entire volume for any\r\n   recoverable files/directories/volumes.\r\n\r\nHere are the manual mode Command Line Usages:\r\n\r\nDiagnose Phase Command Line Usage:\r\n   refsutil salvage -D <source volume> <working directory> <options>\r\n\r\n   Attempt to determine if <source volume> is an ReFS volume and determine\r\n   if the volume is mountable. When a volume is not-mountable, reason(s) will\r\n   be determined.  This is a standalone phase.\r\n\r\nQuick Scan Phase Command Line Usage:\r\n   refsutil salvage -QS <source volume> <working directory> <options>\r\n\r\n   Quick Scan <source volume> for any recoverable files.\r\n   This mode runs quicker as it assumes some critical structures of the volume\r\n   are not corrupted and so there is no need to scan the entire volume to\r\n   locate them.  This also reduces the recovery of stale files/directories/volumes.\r\n   Discovered files will be logged to "foundfiles.<volume signature>.txt" under\r\n   <working directory>.  If the Scan Phase was previously stopped, running with\r\n   the -QS flag again will resume the scan from where it left off.\r\n\r\nFull Scan Phase Command Line Usage:\r\n   refsutil salvage -FS <source volume> <working directory> <options>\r\n\r\n   Scan entire <source volume> for any recoverable files.\r\n   This mode may take a long time as it will scan the entire volume for any\r\n   recoverable files.\r\n   Discovered files will be logged to "foundfiles.<volume signature>.txt" under\r\n   <working directory>.  If the Scan Phase was previously stopped, running with\r\n   the -FS flag again will resume the scan from where it left off.\r\n\r\nCopy Phase Command Line Usage:\r\n   refsutil salvage -C <source volume> <working directory> <target directory> <options>\r\n\r\n   Copy all files described in "foundfiles.<volume signature>.txt" to\r\n   <target directory>.  If Scan Phase is stopped too early,\r\n   "foundfiles.<volume signature>.txt" may not have been written yet and so no file\r\n   will be copied to <target directory>.\r\n\r\nCopy Phase with List Command Line Usage:\r\n   refsutil salvage -SL <source volume> <working directory> <target directory> <file list> <options>\r\n\r\n   Copy all the files in <file list> from <source volume> to <target directory>.\r\n   The files in <file list> must have first been identified by the Scan Phase\r\n   though the scan need not have been run to completion.\r\n   <file list> can be generated by copying "foundfiles.<volume signature>.txt"\r\n   to a new file, removing lines referencing files that shouldn't be restored,\r\n   and preserving files that should be restored.  The PowerShell cmdlet\r\n   Select-String may be helpful in filtering "foundfiles.<volume signature>.txt"\r\n   to only include desired paths, extensions, or file names.\r\n\r\nCopy Phase with Interactive Console:\r\n   refsutil salvage -IC <source volume> <working directory> <options>\r\n\r\n   Salvage files in an interactive console for advanced users.\r\n   This mode also requires files generated from either of the Scan Phases.\r\n\r\n\r\nParameter definitions:\r\n\r\n<source volume>         ReFS volume to process. Drive letter in format "L:",\r\n                        or a path to the volume mount point.\r\n<working directory>     Location to store temporary information and logs.\r\n                        It must not be located on <source volume>.\r\n<target directory>      Location where identified files will be copied to.\r\n                        It must not be located on <source volume>.\r\n<options>\r\n   -m                   Recover all possible files including deleted ones.\r\n                        This option will be ignored on refsutil salvage v1.\r\n                        WARNING: Not only this will take longer time to run,\r\n                        it can lead to unexpected result.\r\n   -v                   Verbose mode\r\n   -x                   Force the volume to dismount first if necessary.  All\r\n                        opened handles to the volume would then be invalid.\r\n\r\nEg: refsutil salvage -QA R: N:\WORKING N:\DATA -x\r\n\r\n
