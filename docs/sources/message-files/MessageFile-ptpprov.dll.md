0xb000020b | The timestamp settings on the NICs in this system are ambiguous, with a combination of different kinds of timestamping enabled. The resulting timestamps may not be translated correctly, resulting in sub-optimal time sync accuracy. There could also be path asymmetry due to the use of different kinds of timestamp types on different NICs in the system. For best results, enable a single kind of timestamping on all NICs in the system.%nCurrent Tick Count:%1%nFor more information, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=873491.\r\n
