Message identifier | Message string
--- | ---
0x4fff000a | This drive has not been shown to support digital audio playback.\r\n
0x8fff0009 | The stream has paused to prevent stuttering.  If this message occurs often,\r\nthe cdrom drive may not be capable of providing a real-time stream of audio\r\ndata during normal computer use.\r\n
0xcfff0000 | Too many consecutive read errors, audio playback stopped.\r\nThis may indicate your hardware cannot support raw audio reads or that the\r\ncdrom was ejected during playback.\r\n
0xcfff0001 | Too many consecutive stream errors, audio playback stopped.\r\nThe output audio device may have changed in an unsafe manner,\r\nbeen removed, or have other problems.\r\n
0xcfff0002 | Redbook could not open the MIXER device.  It may not exist,\r\nbe in use, or there may be other audio problems.  Redbook requires both a\r\nWDM audio driver and kernel streaming to be enabled. The audio device\r\nmay have changed in an unsafe manner, been removed, or have other problems.\r\n
0xcfff0003 | Redbook could not create a virtual source for the MIXER device.\r\nThe MIXER may not exist, be in use, or there may be other audio\r\nproblems.  Redbook requires both a WDM audio driver and kernel streaming\r\nto be enabled.\r\n
0xcfff0004 | Redbook could not open the default playback device.  It may not exist,\r\nbe in use, or there may be other audio issues.  Redbook requires both a\r\nWDM audio driver and kernel streaming to be enabled. The output audio\r\nmay have changed in an unsafe manner, been removed, or have other problems.\r\n
0xcfff0005 | Redbook could not determine the number of pins (interfaces) for the\r\ndefault playback device.  This is most likely an issue with the\r\naudio drivers.  Redbook requires both a WDM audio driver and kernel\r\nstreaming to be enabled.\r\n
0xcfff0006 | Redbook could not connect to any valid playback pins.  Redbook\r\nconnects only to 44.1KHz 16-bit stereo pins.  Redbook requires both a WDM\r\naudio driver and kernel streaming to be enabled. The output audio device\r\nmay have changed in an unsafe manner, it may have been removed, or it may\r\nhave other problems.\r\n
0xcfff0007 | Redbook was unable to initialize its WMI routines, which may cause a cdrom\r\nto be inaccessible during this boot.\r\n
0xcfff2008 | Could not create thread.  Playback will be disabled.\r\n
