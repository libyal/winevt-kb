0x00001f41 | Unable to start DNS Client service. Could not start the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interface for this service. To correct the problem, you may restart the RPC and DNS Client services. To do so, use the following commands at a command prompt: (1) type 'net start rpc' to start the RPC service, and (2) type 'net start dnscache' to start the DNS Client service.

This is probably because the authoritative DNS server for the name being updated is not running.%n%nYou can manually retry registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig /registerdns' at the command prompt. If problems still  persist, contact your network systems administrator to verify network conditions.\r\n

This may be due to a zone transfer that has locked the DNS server for the applicable zone that your computer needs to register itself with.%n%n(The applicable zone should typically correspond to the Adapter-specific Domain Suffix that was indicated above.) You can manually retry registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig /registerdns' at the command prompt.

This could happen for the following reasons: (a) current DNS update policies do not allow this computer to update the DNS domain name configured for this adapter, or (b) the authoritative DNS server for this DNS domain name does not support the DNS dynamic update protocol.%n%nTo register a DNS host (A or AAAA) resource record using the specific DNS domain name for this adapter, contact your DNS server or network systems administrator.\r\n

This could happen for the following reasons: (a) the DNS domain name that your computer is trying to register could not be updated because your computer does not have the right permissions, or (b) there might have been a problem negotiating valid credentials with the DNS server to update.%n%nYou can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig /registerdns' at the command prompt.

This may be because the reverse lookup zone is busy or missing on the DNS server that your computer needs to update. In most cases, this is a minor problem because it does not affect normal (forward) name resolution.%n%nIf reverse (address-to-name) resolution is required for your computer, you can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig /registerdns' at the command prompt. If problems still persist, contact your DNS server or network systems administrator. See event details for specific error code information.\r\n

0x00001f41 | Unable to start DNS Client service. Could not start the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interface for this service. To correct the problem, you may restart the RPC and DNS Client services.

This may be because the reverse lookup zone is busy or missing on the DNS server that your computer needs to update. In most cases, this is a minor problem because it does not affect normal (forward) name resolution.%n%nIf reverse (address-to-name) resolution is required for your computer, you can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig /registerdns' at the command prompt.

A possible cause is that a zone transfer is in progress, causing a lock for the zone at the DNS server authorized to perform the updates for these RRs.\r\n

The cause of this might be that either (a) this computer is not allowed to update the DNS domain name specified by these settings, or (b) because the DNS server authorized to perform updates for the zone that contains these RRs does not support the DNS dynamic update protocol.\r\n
